Synthesis of shell/core structural nitrogen-doped carbon/silicon carbide and its electrochemical properties as a cathode catalyst for fuel cells,Electrochemistry Communications,2013,"A shell/core structural N-doped carbon/silicon carbide (N-doped C/SiC) was prepared by two-steps: pre-carbonization and N doping process. The first step was carried out on nano-SiC using acid etching method. Nanoporous amorphous carbons were formed on the surface of SiC after acid etching, which could make it easy to adsorb N source and reduce the energy needed in the next step. The prepared N-doped C/SiC exhibited a high durability and a good catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction.

A Platinum Monolayer Core-Shell Catalyst with a Ternary Alloy Nanoparticle Core and Enhanced Stability for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction,Journal of Nanomaterials,2015,"/C catalyst exhibits excellent oxygen reduction reaction activity, yielding a mass activity significantly higher than that of Pt monolayer catalysts containing PdIr or PdNi nanoparticles as cores and four times higher than that of a commercial Pt/C electrocatalyst. In 0.1â€‰M HClO4, the half-wave potential reaches 0.91â€‰V, about 30â€‰mV higher than that of Pt/C. We verify the structure and composition of the carbon-supported PdIrNi nanoparticles using X-ray powder diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, thermogravimetry, transmission electron microscopy, and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry, and we perform a stability test that confirms the excellent stability of our core-shell catalyst. We suggest that the porous structure resulting from the dissolution of Ni in the alloy nanoparticles may be the main reason for the catalystâ€™s enhanced performance."
Insights into electrochemical dealloying of Cu out of Au-doped Pt-alloy nanoparticles at the sub-nano-scale,Journal of Electrochemical Science and Engineering,2018,"Pt alloy nanoparticles present the most probable candidate to be used as the cathode cathodic oxygen reduction reaction electrocatalyst for achieving commercialization targets of the low-temperature fuel cells. It is therefore very important to understand its activation and degradation processes. Besides the ones known from the pure Pt electrocatalysts, the dealloying phenomena possess a great threat since the leached less-noble metal can interact with the polymer membrane or even poison the electrocatalyst. In this study, we present a solution, supported by in-depth advance electrochemical characterization, on how to suppress the removal of Cu from the Pt alloy nanoparticles."
Effect of solvent on Se-modified ruthenium/carbon catalyst for oxygen reduction,Progress in Natural Science: Materials International,2014,"Se-modified ruthenium supporting on carbon (Sexâ€“Ru/C) electrocatalyst was prepared by solvothermal one-step synthesis method. The reaction mechanism was revealed after discussing impact of different solvents (i-propanol and EG) in solvotermal reaction. The result showed that the grain size of Se-modified ruthenium electrocatalyst was as small as 1 to 3Â nm and highly dispersed on carbon surface. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) presented that selenium mainly existed in the catalyst in the form of elemental selenium and selenium oxides when the solvent was EG and i-propanol, respectively. The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance was improved by appearance of selenium oxides."
Monodispersed Pt<sub>3</sub>Ni Nanoparticles as a Highly Efficient Electrocatalyst for PEMFCs,Catalysts,2019,"A facile strategy is proposed to synthesize monodispersed Pt<sub>3</sub>Ni nanoparticles. Such a kind of electrocatalyst shows a larger electrochemical surface area (98.9 m<sup>2</sup> g<sub>pt</sub><sup>&#8722;1</sup>) and double the mass activity of the oxygen reduction reaction activity compared to commercial Pt/C catalyst. The results show that the suitable addition of Ni and triethylamine in the reduction process plays an important role in controlling the size and dispersion of Pt<sub>3</sub>Ni nanoparticles. A further membrane electrode assembly test proves that as-prepared Pt<sub>3</sub>Ni nanoparticles can greatly enhance the electrochemical performance of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell, which exhibits a great potential of application in fuel cells."
Does CO poison Fe-based catalysts for ORR?,Electrochemistry Communications,2010,"Catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) were prepared on carbon black (C) using FeIIphthalocyanine (FePc) and Clâ€“FeIIItetramethoxyphenylporphyrin (ClFeTMPP), as Fe precursors with and without a pyrolysis step at 800Â Â°C. CO poisoning of the ORR catalytic sites for all these Fe/N/C electrocatalysts was attempted at pH 1 and 13, but to no avail, even if an iron ion is known to occupy the center of the active sites in at least the unpyrolyzed FePc/C or ClFeTMPP/C. The exact nature of the active center of these Fe-based heat-treated catalysts may still be a subject of debate but, in light of the absence of CO poisoning for unpyrolyzed FePc/C and ClFeTMPP/C, resistance to CO poisoning by the heat-treated catalysts cannot be used as evidence that the active center of their catalytic site is devoid of iron.

Microscopic Analysis of Steel Corrosion Products in Seawater and Sea-Sand Concrete,Materials,2019,"In this paper, the types, formation time, structural morphology, and influence of steel corrosion products in seawater and sea-sand concrete were studied, and the intermediate and final products of steel corrosion under different conditions were determined. The corrosion products of steel in these concrete specimens under two curing methods were studied separately by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Due to the presence of a large amount of chloride ions in the concrete, the rust layer on the surface of a steel bar contained many intermediates, such as lepidocrocite (&#947;&#8722;FeOOH) and aka-ganeite (&#946;&#8722;FeOOH). Under wet/dry cycles, with the addition and loss of moisture in concrete, various corrosion products were also dynamically converted into each other. In the specimens immersed in seawater for a long time, the intermediates of corrosion were lepidocrocite (&#947;&#8722;FeOOH) and aka-ganeite (&#946;&#8722;FeOOH), which were substituted for oxygen as the new depolarizers of cathode reduction reaction, and consumed themselves to ensure smooth corrosion."
Supportless PdFe nanorods as highly active electrocatalyst for proton exchange membrane fuel cell,Electrochemistry Communications,2009,"The PdFe nanorods (PdFe-NRs) with tunable length were synthesized by an organic phase reaction of [Pd(acac)2] and thermal decomposition of [Fe(CO)5] in a mixture of oleyamine and octadecene at 160Â Â°C. They show a better proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) performance than commercial Pt/C in working voltage region of 0.80â€“0.65Â V, due to their high intrinsic activity to oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), reduced cell inner resistance, and improved mass transport.

"Pt monolayer shell on hollow Pd core electrocatalysts: Scale up synthesis, structure, and activity for the oxygen reduction reaction",Journal of the Serbian Chemical Society,2013,"We report on synthesis, characterization and the oxygen reduction reaction   (ORR) kinetics of Pt monolayer shell on Pd(hollow), or Pd-Au(hollow) core   electrocatalysts. Comparison between the ORR catalytic activity of the   electrocatalysts with hollow cores and those of Pt solid and Pt hollow   nanoparticles has been obtained using the rotating disk electrode technique.   Hollow nanoparticles were made using Ni or Cu nanoparticles as sacrificial   templates. The Pt ORR specific and mass activities of the electrocatalysts   with hollow cores were found considerably higher than those of the   electrocatalysts with the solid cores. We attribute this enhanced Pt activity   to the smooth surface morphology and hollow-induced lattice contraction, in   addition to the mass-saving geometry of hollow particles."
Novel Porous Nitrogen Doped Graphene/Carbon Black Composites as Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction Electrocatalyst for Power Generation in Microbial Fuel Cell,Nanomaterials,2019,"To improve the power generation of a microbial fuel cell (MFC), a porous nitrogen-doped graphene/carbon black (NG/CB) composite as efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalyst was successfully synthesized by pyrolyzing graphene oxide (GO) encapsulated CB with cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide as a bridge. This concept-to-proof synthesis can be considered as a template-like method. Based on this method, one composite named as NG/CB-10 was acquired using the optimized GO-to-CB mass ratio of 10:1. Electrochemical tests demonstrate that NG/CB-10 can catalyze ORR in neutral-pH medium through a four-electron pathway with positively shifted the onset potential, the enhanced current density and reduced charge transfer resistance. CB addition also prolongs the stability of NG/CB-10. The enhancement in electrochemical performance of NG/CB-10 was attributed to the enlarged surface area, abundant mesopores and high content of pyridinic nitrogen. The maximum power density of MFC equipping NG/CB-10 as cathode electrocatalyst reached 936 mW&#183;m<sup>&#8722;2</sup>, which was 26% higher than that of NG and equal to that of platinum/carbon. The cost of NG/CB-10 was reduced by 25% compared with that of NG. This work provides a novel method to synthesize promising ORR electrocatalyst for MFC in the future."
"Alloyed Pt3M (M = Co, Ni) nanoparticles supported on S- and N-doped carbon nanotubes for the oxygen reduction reaction",Beilstein Journal of Nanotechnology,2019,"Sulfur- (S-CNT) and nitrogen-doped (N-CNT) carbon nanotubes have been produced by catalytic chemical vapor deposition (c-CVD) and were subject to an annealing treatment. These CNTs were used as supports for small (â‰ˆ2 nm) Pt3M (M = Co or Ni) alloyed nanoparticles that have a very homogeneous size distribution (in spite of the high metal loading of â‰ˆ40 wt % Pt), using an ionic liquid as a stabilizer. The electrochemical surface area, the activity for the oxygen reduction reaction and the amount of H2O2 generated during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) have been evaluated in a rotating ring disk electrode experiment. The Pt3M/N-CNT catalysts revealed excellent electrochemical properties compared to a commercial Pt3Co/Vulcan XC-72 catalyst. The nature of the carbon support plays a key role in determining the properties of the metal nanoparticles, on the preparation of the catalytic layer, and on the electrocatalytic performance in the ORR. On N-CNT supports, the specific activity followed the expected order Pt3Co > Pt3Ni, whereas on the annealed N-CNT support, the order was reversed."
Mitochondrial Protection and Anti-aging Activity of Astragalus Polysaccharides and Their Potential Mechanism,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,2012,"The current study was performed to investigate mitochondrial protection and anti-aging activity of Astragalus polysaccharides (APS) and the potential underlying mechanism. Lipid peroxidation of liver and brain mitochondria was induced by Fe2+â€“Vit C in vitro. Thiobarbituric acid (TBA) colorimetry was used to measure the content of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). Mouse liver mitochondrial permeability transition (PT) was induced by calcium overload in vitro and spectrophotometry was used to measure it. The scavenging activities of APS on superoxide anion (O2â€¢ï_ç) and hydroxyl radical (â€¢OH), which were produced by reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH)â€”N-Methylphenazonium methyl sulfate (PMS) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)â€“Fe2+ system respectively, were measured by 4-nitrobluetetrazolium chloride (NBT) reduction and Fenton reaction colorimetry respectively. The Na2S2O3 titration method was used to measure the scavenging activities of APS on H2O2. APS could inhibit TBARS production, protect mitochondria from PT, and scavenge O2â€¢ï_ç, â€¢OH and H2O2 significantly in a concentration-dependent manner respectively. The back of the neck of mice was injected subcutaneously with D-galactose to induce aging at a dose of 100 mg/kg/d for seven weeks. Moreover, the activities of catalase (CAT), surperoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and anti-hydroxyl radical which were assayed by using commercial monitoring kits were increased significantly in vivo by APS. According to this research, APS protects mitochondria by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS), inhibiting mitochondrial PT and increasing the activities of antioxidases. Therefore, APS has the effect of promoting health."
Heteroatom-doped porous carbon from methyl orange dye wastewater for oxygen reduction,Green Energy & Environment,2018,"Banana peel-derived porous carbon (BPPC) was prepared from banana peel and used as an adsorbent for methyl orange (MO) wastewater removal. BPPC-MO50 is a N,S-doped BPPC obtained via secondary carbonization. The BPPC-MO50 exhibited a high specific surface area of 1774.3Â m2/g. Heteroatom-doped porous carbon (PC) was successfully synthesized from the BPPC absorbed MO at high temperature and used for oxygen reduction. The BPPC-MO50 displayed the highest ORR onset potential among all carbon-based electrocatalysts, i.e., 0.93Â V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). This is the first report to describe porous carbon-activated materials from agriculture and forestry waste that is used for adsorption of dyes from wastewater via an enhanced heteroatom (N,S) content. These results may contribute to the sustainable development of dye wastewater treatment by transforming saturated PC into an effective material and has potential applications in fuel cells or as energy sources.

A Facile Method for the Preparation of Colored Bi4Ti3O12âˆ’x Nanosheets with Enhanced Visible-Light Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Activity,Nanomaterials,2018,"Bi4Ti3O12&minus;x nanosheet photocatalysts with abundant oxygen vacancies are fabricated by a facile solid-state chemical reduction method for the first time. This method is simple in operation, has short reaction time, and can be conducted at mild temperatures (300~400 &deg;C). The electron paramagnetic resonance, thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectrometer, and positron annihilation lifetime spectra results indicate that oxygen vacancies are produced in Bi4Ti3O12&minus;x, and they can be adjusted by tuning the reduction reaction conditions. Control experiments show that the reduction time and temperature have great influences on the photocatalytic activities of Bi4Ti3O12&minus;x. The optimal Bi4Ti3O12&minus;x is the sample undergoing the reduction treatment at 350 &deg;C for 60 min and it affords a hydrogen evolution rate of 129 &mu;mol&middot;g&minus;1&middot;h&minus;1 under visible-light irradiation, which is about 3.4 times that of the pristine Bi4Ti3O12. The Bi4Ti3O12&minus;x photocatalysts have good reusability and storage stability and can be used to decompose formaldehyde and formic acid for hydrogen production. The surface oxygen vacancies states result in the broadening of the valence band and the narrowing of the band gap. Such energy level structure variation helps promote the separation of photo-generated electron-hole pairs thus leading to enhancement in the visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Meanwhile, the narrowing of the band gap leads to a broader visible light absorption of Bi4Ti3O12&minus;x."
A review of oxygen reduction mechanisms for metal-free carbon-based electrocatalysts,npj Computational Materials,2019,"Abstract The sluggish kinetics of Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR) at the cathode in proton exchange membrane fuel cells or metal-air batteries requires highly effective and stable electrocatalysts to boost the reaction. The low abundance and high price of Pt-based electrocatalysts hamper the widespread application of proton exchange membrane fuel cells and metal-air batteries. As promising alternatives, metal-free carbon materials, especially upon doping heteroatoms or creating defects demonstrated excellent ORR activity, which is as efficient as or even superior to commercial platinum on carbon. Significant progress on the development of advanced carbon materials as highly stable and durable catalysts has been achieved, but the catalytic mechanisms of these materials still remain undistinguished. In present review, we summarized the up-to-date progress in the studies of carbon materials, and emphasized on the combination of experiment and theory to clarify the underlying mechanisms of these materials. At last, we proposed the perspectives on the proper strategies of elucidating the mechanisms of carbon materials as electrocatalysts towards ORR."
Investigation of Earth-Abundant Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysts for the Cathode of Passive Air-Breathing Direct Formate Fuel Cells,Catalysts,2018,"The development of direct formate fuel cells encounters important obstacles related to the sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and low tolerance to formate ions in Pt-based cathodes. In this study, electrocatalysts formed by earth-abundant elements were synthesized, and their activity and selectivity for the ORR were tested in alkaline electrolyte. The results showed that carbon-encapsulated iron-cobalt alloy nanoparticles and carbon-supported metal nitrides, characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), do not present significant activity for the ORR, showing the same half-wave potential of Vulcan carbon. Contrarily, nitrogen-doped carbon, synthesized using imidazole as the nitrogen source, showed an increase in the half-wave potential, evidencing an influential role of nitrogen in the ORR electrocatalysis. The synthesis with the combination of Vulcan, imidazole, and iron or cobalt precursors resulted in the formation of nitrogen-coordinated iron (or cobalt) moieties, inserted in a carbon matrix, as revealed by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Steady-state polarization curves for the ORR evidenced a synergistic effect between Fe and Co when these two metals were included in the synthesis (FeCo-N-C material), showing higher activity and higher limiting current density than the materials prepared only with Fe or Co. The FeCo-N-C material presented not only the highest activity for the ORR (approaching that of the state-of-the-art Pt/C) but also high tolerance to the presence of formate ions in the electrolyte. In addition, measurements with FeCo-N-C in the cathode of an passive air-breathing direct formate fuel cells, (natural diffusion of formate), showed peak power densities of 15.5 and 10.5 mW cm&minus;2 using hydroxide and carbonate-based electrolytes, respectively, and high stability over 120 h of operation."
Green synthesis of nitrogen-doped self-assembled porous carbon-metal oxide composite towards energy and environmental applications,Scientific Reports,2019,"Abstract Increasing environmental pollution, shortage of efficient energy conversion and storage devices and the depletion of fossil fuels have triggered the research community to look for advanced multifunctional materials suitable for different energy-related applications. Herein, we have discussed a novel and facile synthesis mechanism of such a carbon-based nanocomposite along with its energy and environmental applications. In this present work, nitrogen-doped carbon self-assembled into ordered mesoporous structure has been synthesized via an economical and environment-friendly route and its pore generating mechanism depending on the hydrogen bonding interaction has been highlighted. Incorporation of metal oxide nanoparticles in the porous carbon network has significantly improved CO2 adsorption and lithium storage capacity along with an improvement in the catalytic activity towards Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR). Thus our present study unveils a multifunctional material that can be used in three different fields without further modifications."
Glial activation in nitrous oxide toxicity is related to oxidative stress and glutamate excitotoxicity,Canadian Journal of Biotechnology,2017,"Myelin disorders can be due to diverse mechanisms such as autoimmune, parainfectious, metabolic or toxic. The prototype of immune mediated demyelination is multiple sclerosis. To understand the underlying mechanism of cell damage in vitamin b12 deficiency, a number of animal models have been used which include total gastrectomy (TGX), cobalamine deficient diet and N2O exposure (Tredici G, et al., 1998;Scalabrino G, 2001). Six adult wistar male rats were exposed to N2O oxygen mixture in 1:1 ratio at a rate of 2 L/min for 120 min for 60 days. The control rats received only oxygen and room air. At the end of exposure, spontaneous locomotor activity (total distance travelled, time resting, time moving, number of rearing, stereotypic count) and grip strength. Plasma glutathione (GSH), total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and serum malonodialdehyde (MDA) and serum homocysteine (Hcy) were measured by spectrophotometer. Glutamate in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum was measured by colorimetry. Immunohistochemistry for GFAP expression in brain and spinal cord was done and quantified using image J software. The N2O exposed rats had significant reduction in total distance travelled, time moving, number of rearing and increased time resting compared to the controls. Hcy, glutamate and MDA levels were increased, and GSH and TAC decreased in N2O exposed group compared to the controls. GFAP was more expressed in N2O exposed group, and its expression was higher in spinal cord compared to brain. The GFAP expression correlated with neurobehavioral changes, oxidative stress and glutamate level.N2O toxicity results in GFAP expression suggesting astrocytic reaction, which is mediated by oxidative stress and excitotoxicity."
Highly dispersed Ag nanoparticles on nanosheets of reduced graphene oxide for oxygen reduction reaction in alkaline media,Electrochemistry Communications,2013,"Uniformly dispersed Ag nanoparticles were successfully obtained on reduced graphene oxide (RGO) through the simultaneous reduction of Ag and graphene oxide (GO) without surfactant by controlling growth of Ag nanoparticles at low temperatures. Using this method, even a high metal loading of 60Â wt.% Ag with a mean diameter of less than 10Â nm could be achieved over the RGO sheets. The oxygen reduction reaction activity was investigated using an RGO-supported Ag catalyst (Ag/RGO) in a 0.1Â M NaOH solution, and the kinetic parameters were determined using the rotating disk electrode (RDE) technique. For comparison, a commercial carbon-supported Ag catalyst (Ag/C) was investigated under identical experimental conditions.

Constraints on superoxide mediated formation of manganese oxides,Frontiers in Microbiology,2013,"Manganese (Mn) oxides are among the most reactive sorbents and oxidants within the environment, where they play a central role in the cycling of nutrients, metals, and carbon.  Recent discoveries have identified superoxide (O2-) (both of biogenic and abiogenic origin) as an effective oxidant of Mn(II) leading to the formation of Mn oxides. Here we examined the conditions under which abiotically produced superoxide led to oxidative precipitation of Mn and the solid-phases produced. Oxidized Mn, as both aqueous Mn(III) and Mn(III/IV) oxides, was only observed in the presence of active catalase, indicating that hydrogen peroxide, a product of the reaction of O2- with Mn(II), inhibits the oxidation process presumably through the reduction of Mn(III).  Citrate and pyrophosphate increased the yield of oxidized Mn but decreased the amount of Mn oxide produced via formation of Mn(III)-ligand complexes. While complexing ligands played a role in stabilizing Mn(III), they did not eliminate the inhibition of net Mn(III) formation by H2O2. The Mn oxides precipitated were highly disordered colloidal hexagonal birnessite, similar to those produced by biotically generated superoxide.  Yet, in contrast to the large particulate Mn oxides formed by biogenic superoxide, abiotic Mn oxides did not ripen to larger, more crystalline phases.  This suggests that the deposition of crystalline Mn oxides within the environment requires a biological, or at least organic, influence.  This work provides the first direct evidence that, under conditions relevant to natural waters, oxidation of Mn(II) by superoxide can occur and lead to formation of Mn oxides. For organisms that oxidize Mn(II) by producing superoxide, these findings may also point to other microbially mediated processes, in particular enzymatic hydrogen peroxide degradation and/or production of organic ligand metabolites, that allow for Mn oxide formation."
Design and Development of Methanol Sensing MEMS Sensor for DMFC Technology,MATEC Web of Conferences,2018,"The sensors can be developed based on ampherometric principle using Direct Methanol Fuel Cell (DMFC) technology. The synthesis of cost effective electrocatalyst materials for improved oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and preparing electrodes by using suitable methods to reduce the cost of the sensing electrode is the major objective of the present work. Pt-Sn alloy exhibits high sensitivity in ORR among other Pt alloys and hence will be used as the ORR catalysts. For various concentration of methanol at different temperature, the current density of the chemically synthesised and characterized Pt-Sn/C was analysed. The accuracy will be determined by the detection of electric current or changes in electric current to design the sensor. To analyse the sensor accuracy, we have used passive mode design protocol in COMSOL Multiphysics. From the constructed cell of 1.0 cm cell area, we can optimize the overall power density and hence the sensitivity of the sensor by the modification of the cell parameters and interfacing it with Darcyâ€™s law of fluidic flow through porous electrode medium. The micro electro mechanical systems (MEMS) technology was used for the design and fabrication of sensor with the electrochemical inputs from a standard DMFC single cell arrangement. The cell structure has been fabricated using a 3D printing technology and the output of the cell was optimized for ampherometric detection. The sensor with microfludic interconnects were fabricated by MEMS technology. The sensor response characteristics were studied and will be presented."
One-Dimensional Simulation of the In-Situ Oil Combustion with Consideration to Fluid and Solid Combustible Components,IzvestiÃ¢ VysÅ¡ih UÄçebnyh Zavedenij i ÃˆnergetiÄçeskih ob Edinennij SNG. Ãˆnergetika,2019,"The one-dimensional axisymmetric problem of initiation of a combustion wave in an oil-saturated reservoir is solved numerically. Two combustible components, viz. liquid (oil) and solid (kerogen, oil sorbate) were considered. The influence of the abovementioned components on time of the hot site ignition and combustion front speed was simulated and analyzed. It was demonstrated that growth of the mass fraction of liquid component (the total heat content being preserved) results in retard of formation of the hot site near the well and in reduction of the maximum temperature of the combustion wave, disregarding of the higher reactivity of liquid combustible. Simulation revealed existence of the two â€œpeaksâ€ù of thermal front velocity. The first one corresponds by time to ignition of combustion site. The second one corresponds to a moment when the solid component combustion front overrides the oil displacement front. Calculations shown, that thermal wave propagation velocity, at least after passing the â€œpeaksâ€ù and transition to quasi-steady regime, does not considerably depend on mass traction of the fluid component in the system. A typical term of the exothermic reaction site formation may increase from 50 to 200 days in case of growth of the liquid component content from 30 to 80 mass % at the considered thermal conditions in the oil reservoir. Thus, the implementation of the thermo-gas method in high-productive layers increases the likelihood of difficulty of initiation of a fire. Therefore, the study of the regularities of intra-combustion in such cases is of a particular interest. For instance, the task of combustion site ignition may be resolved by increase of oxygen content in blowing-gas or by means of non-steady (periodical) blowing. It is found that taking into consideration of highly reactive liquid component results in widening (diffusion) of the thermal front, which may play positive role in its spatial thermo-hydrodynamic stabilization. The results of simulation may be utilized for development of technical projects of oil recovery via in-situ combustion, for designing of furnaces utilizing multicomponent fixed layer fuels and for thermochemical investigation of multicomponent fuels."
Sulfur-containing carbon by flame synthesis as efficient metal-free electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction,Electrochemistry Communications,2013,"Sulfur-containing carbon soot is prepared for the first time through simple flame synthesis by burning flammable thiophene, and it exhibits excellent catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction in alkaline media. The flame synthesis provides not only a rapid single step low-cost approach, but also very efficient and scalable methodology for metal-free sulfur-containing carbons with good control on the sulfur content.

Preparation of Bimetallic Pd-Co Nanoparticles on Graphene Support for Use as Methanol Tolerant Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysts,"Engineering, Technology & Applied Science Research",2012,"Graphene-supported (40-x) wt% Pd x wt% Co (0â‰_xâ‰_13.33) alloys/composites have been prepared by a microwave-assisted polyol reduction method and been investigated for their structural and electrocatalytic properties for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in 0.5 M H2SO4 at 298 K. The study demonstrated that the bimetallic Pd-Co composite nanoparticles are, in fact, alloy nanoparticles with fcc crystalline structure. Partial substitution of Pd by Co (from 3.64 to 13.33 wt%) in 40 wt% Pd/graphene decreases the lattice parameter as well as the crystallite size and increases the apparent catalytic activity, the latter, however, being the greatest with 8 wt% Co. The ORR activity of the active 32 wt% Pd 8wt% Co is found to be considerably low when it was deposited on the support multiwall carbon nanotubes under similar conditions. The rotating disk electrode study indicated that the ORR on 32 wt% Pd 8 wt% Co/GNS in 0.5 M H2SO4 follows approximately the four-electron pathway."
PdPt alloy nanocubes as electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction in acid media,Electrochemistry Communications,2015,"In this work, PdPt alloy nanocubes with different metal ratios were synthesised in the presence of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). The surface morphology of the PdPt samples was characterised by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). TEM images showed that PdPt nanoparticles were cubic-shaped and the average size of the cubes was about 8â€“10Â nm. Their electrocatalytic activity towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was studied in 0.5Â M H2SO4 using the rotating disc electrode method. All the alloyed catalysts showed enhanced electrocatalytic activity for ORR as compared to the monometallic cubic Pd nanoparticles. Half-wave potential values for PdPt catalysts were comparable with that of Pt nanocubes. From the alloyed catalysts Pd36Pt64 exhibited the highest specific activity, which was only slightly lower than that of cubic Pt nanoparticles. The Kouteckyâ€“Levich analysis revealed that the reduction of oxygen proceeded via 4-electron pathway on all the electrocatalysts studied.

Improved lifetime of PEM fuel cell catalysts through polymer stabilization,Electrochemistry Communications,2009,"A novel approach to increase lifetime of Pt/C catalysts was demonstrated and shown that Nafion-stabilized Pt catalyst (denoted here as Nafion-Pt/C) synthesized by a colloid route gives rise to an enhanced durability as compared to a conventional Pt/C catalysts commonly used in PEM fuel cell. A high catalytic activity of the catalyst is also observed by both CV (cyclic voltammetry) and ORR (oxygen reduction reaction) measurements. This catalyst durability in comparison with conventional Pt/C is increased directly by electrochemically-accelerated durability test (ADT). The loss rate of electrochemical active area (ECA) for Nafion-Pt/C catalysts is only 0.004Â m2Â gâˆ’1Â cycleâˆ’1, compared to a value of 0.012Â m2Â gâˆ’1Â cycleâˆ’1 for Pt/C. This indicates the catalyst is three times higher durability than Pt/C. Keywords: Fuel cell, Catalyst, Catalyst durability, Nafion-stabilized Pt catalyst"
Electrochemical Reduction of Oxygen on Anthraquinone/Carbon Nanotubes Nanohybrid Modified Glassy Carbon Electrode in Neutral Medium,Journal of Chemistry,2013,The electrochemical behaviors of monohydroxy-anthraquinone/multiwall carbon nanotubes (MHAQ/MWCNTs) nanohybrid modified glassy carbon (MHAQ/MWCNTs/GC) electrodes in neutral medium were investigated; also reported was their application in the electrocatalysis of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The resulting MHAQ/MWCNTs nanohybrid was characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). It was found that the ORR at the MHAQ/MWCNTs/GC electrode occurs irreversibly at a potential about 214â€‰mV less negative than at a bare GC electrode in pHâ€‰7.0 buffer solution. Cyclic voltammetric and rotating disk electrode (RDE) techniques indicated that the MHAQ/MWCNTs nanohybrid has high electrocatalytic activity for the two-electron reduction of oxygen in the studied potential range. The kinetic parameters of ORR at the MHAQ/MWCNTs nanohybrid modified GC electrode were also determined by RDE and EIS techniques.
Silver Modified Degussa P25 for the Photocatalytic Removal of Nitric Oxide,International Journal of Photoenergy,2007,"A study of the photocatalytic behaviour of silver modified titanium dioxide materials for the decomposition and reduction of nitric oxide (NO) gas has been carried out. The effects of silver loading, calcination temperature, and reaction conditions have been investigated. Prepared photocatalysts were characterised using XRD, TEM, and XPS. A continuous flow reactor was used to determine the photocatalytic activity and selectivity of NO decomposition in the absence of oxygen as well as NO reduction using CO as the reducing agent, over the prepared photocatalysts. XRD and TEM analysis of the photocatalysts showed that crystalline silver nitrate particles were present on the titanium dioxide surface after calcination at temperatures of up to 200âˆ˜C. The silver nitrate particles are thermally decomposed to form metallic silver clusters at higher temperatures. XPS analysis of the photocatalysts showed that for each of the temperatures used, both Ag+ and Ag0 were present and that the Ag0/Ag+ ratio increased with increasing calcination temperature. The presence of metallic silver species on the TiO2 surface dramatically increased the selectivity for N2 formation of both decomposition and reduction reactions. When CO was present in the reaction gas, selectivities of over 90% were observed for all the Ag-TiO2 photocatalysts that had been calcined at temperatures above 200âˆ˜C. Unfortunately these high selectivities were at the expense of photocatalytic activity, with lower NO conversion rates than those achieved over unmodified TiO2 photocatalysts."
Oxygen reduction at electrochemically deposited crystallographically oriented Au(1Â 0Â 0)-like gold nanoparticles,Electrochemistry Communications,2005,"A novel electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction has been proposed based on the electrodeposition of Au nanoparticles onto glassy carbon (nano Au/GC) electrodes in the presence of some additives, typically cysteine. Steady-state hydrodynamic voltammetric studies for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), in O2-saturated 0.5 M KOH solution, at the thus-prepared nano Au/GC disk electrode have revealed an increasing disk current (ID) (current maxima) up to âˆ’0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl/KCl(sat) compared to the other nano Au/GC disk electrodes prepared under different conditions. This high value (maxima) of ID is associated with a low value of the corresponding Pt ring current (IR) and in turn a higher number of electrons (n) is exchanged at the disk electrode during the ORR in alkaline medium in this potential window. At more cathodic potentials, this disk current maxima vanished and the nano Au/GC disk current showed a minimal value associated with a significant increase in IR. This resembles the behaviour of the ORR at single crystalline Au(1Â 0Â 0) disk electrodes in the similar media. Thus, a 4-electron reduction of oxygen to water can be accomplished at a reasonably low cathodic overpotential.

Application of silver-tin dioxide composite cathode catalyst for enhancing performance of microbial desalination cell,Materials Science for Energy Technologies,2018,"Microbial desalination cell (MDC) is a novel bioelectrochemical system, capable of removing salts and organic matter from wastewater simultaneously. For improving the performance, a carbon supported silver-tin dioxide (Ag-SnO2) composite was synthesized and used as cathode catalyst in a five-chambered MDC (MDC-1). The results were compared with MDC-2 having no catalyst on the cathode. Saline water with a NaCl concentration of 20â€¯g/L was used to evaluate the desalination efficiency of both the MDCs. The electrochemical studies such as cyclic voltammetry and linear sweep voltammetry of the cathode of MDC-1 revealed the superior reduction kinetics. Increased desalination efficiency was observed in MDC-1 (72.6â€¯Â±â€¯3.0%) due to presence of Ag-SnO2 catalyst as compared to MDC-2 (57.9â€¯Â±â€¯8.6%). Maximum power density of 1.47â€¯W/m3, demonstrated by MDC-1, was noted to be 1.67 times higher than that of MDC-2 (0.88â€¯W/m3). In addition, the coulombic efficiency of MDC-1 was observed to be 14.4â€¯Â±â€¯0.2%, which was significantly higher than that observed in MDC-2 (9.5â€¯Â±â€¯0.3%). Performance results confirmed the excellent catalytic activity of Ag-SnO2 composite catalyst to be used on the cathode of MDCs, to take forward this cutting-edge technology for field scale application.

The supplementary addition of alkalinity and the previous biomass inoculation provided a stable start-up of the reactor, as confirmed by the reduction of volatile acids and an adaptation of the present microbiology community. The systems showed resistance to changes in flow and in the organic load observed; the levels of phenol and potassium monitored did not cause inhibition of the biological activity. A better control on the changes in load rates is an important topic for the next studies."
Oxygen-Containing Nanoclusters on the Surface of Pt-Electrodes and Oxygen Reduction Reaction in Alkaline Medium,International Journal of Electrochemistry,2018,"Analysis of the role of oxygen-containing nanoclusters in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on Pt-electrodes in alkaline media is provided on the basis of the concept of electrochemical processes with slowed stage of consecutive heterogeneous chemical reaction (ConHCR). Under the ConHCR concept, the main factor determining the ORR characteristics is energetic inhomogeneity of electrode surface (EIES) according to Temkin. A new concept, according to which EIES is determined by the Gibbs energy of formation of oxygen-containing surface structures with inclusions of surface defects of the platinum crystal structure, Pts,d, is formulated. A correlation between the level of EIES of Pt-electrodes and packing density of Pts,d atoms on the surface of Pt(hkl) monocrystals is determined. The concept, according to which the stationary potential of ORR process is considered as a â€œmixed potentialâ€ù of two reactions (electrochemical reduction of surface atom PtIIs,d and consecutive oxidation of PtIs,d by molecular oxygen), is substantiated. It is proposed that the formation of surface nanocluster transition state [âÅ_(OO)PtIIs,d(OH)] defines the rate of the entire ORR process on Pt-electrodes in alkaline media."
Nitrogen-doped carbon-based electrocatalysts synthesised by ball-milling,Electrochemistry Communications,2018,"Herein, for the first time, ball-milling of carbon materials (e.g. graphite, graphene oxide or graphene) in the presence of dicyandiamide (DCDA) followed by heat treatment at 800â€¯Â°C was employed to synthesise N-doped carbons for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline medium. The obtained results highlight that: i) the N-doped nanocarbon catalysts synthesis process employed herein is easy and could be used without hazardous solvents; ii) X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated successful N-doping, iii) N-doped graphite and graphene are Mn-free as confirmed by the ICP-MS analysis, iv) the ORR electrocatalytic activity depends on the carbon source used for the catalyst preparation and v) all the N-doped nanocarbons revealed better ORR performance than the undoped materials.

Oxygen reduction activity dependence on the mesoporous structure of imprinted carbon supports,Electrochemistry Communications,2010,"Two mesoporous carbons (with 15 (CIC-15) and 26Â nm (CIC-26) diameter pores) were synthesized using a silica colloid imprinting method, loaded with 10Â wt.% Pt, and then evaluated (against Vulcanâ„¢ carbon (VC)) as oxygen reduction (ORR) catalysts for use in proton exchange membrane fuel cells. Both Pt/CICs reproducibly out-performed Pt/VC, with Pt/CIC-15 demonstrating higher ORR activity than Pt/CIC-26, despite its smaller pore size and lower surface area. Transmission electron tomography showed that the Pt nanoparticles (4â€“5Â nm diameter) are fully deposited throughout the pores of the CICs and that the pore distribution in CIC-26 is partially ordered, while CIC-15 shows no ordering of its pores. Importantly, using the powerful imaging capabilities of transmission electron tomography, a first-time correlation is demonstrated between the ORR activity and the wall thickness of the carbon support materials. Pt/CIC-15 has significantly thicker walls, giving a lower measured electronic resistance, a lower ORR Tafel slope, and thus better performance overall compared to Pt/CIC-26.

"Synthesis and characterization of Ln2O2SO4 (Ln = Gd, Ho, Dy and Lu) nanoparticles obtained by coprecipitation method and study of their reduction reaction under H2 flow",Journal of Nanostructure in Chemistry,2017,"Abstract We have proposed an optimized homogeneous precipitation method for the synthesis of spherical and well-dispersed pure Ln2O2SO4 (Ln = Gd, Ho, Dy and Lu) nanoparticles (NPs) using synthesized lanthanide sulfates and urea as starting materials. Ln2O2SO4 NPs can be easily transformed to Ln2O2S by reduction under H2 flow at 650Â Â°C for Gd, Dy and Ho whereas the reduction with Lu gave only Lu2O3. Particle size was between 500Â nm and 3.5Â Âµm. This reduction method allows to obtain Ln2O2S without using H2S which is highly toxic and uncomfortable gas. Ln2O2SO4/Ln2O2S synthetized can be used for release and oxygen storage or doped with luminescent centers for multimodal medical imaging applications. Graphical abstract"
One-step synthesis of carbon-supported Pdâ€“Pt alloy electrocatalysts for methanol tolerant oxygen reduction,Electrochemistry Communications,2008,"A facile, one-step reduction route was developed to synthesize Pd-rich carbon-supported Pdâ€“Pt alloy electrocatalysts of different Pd/Pt atomic ratios. As-prepared Pdâ€“Pt/C catalysts exhibit a single phase fcc structure and an expansion lattice parameter. Comparison of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on the Pdâ€“Pt/C alloy catalysts indicates that the Pd3Pt1/C bimetallic catalyst exhibits the highest ORR activity among all the Pdâ€“Pt alloy catalysts and shows a comparative ORR activity with the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Moreover, all the Pdâ€“Pt alloy catalysts exhibited much higher methanol tolerance during the ORR than the commercial Pt/C catalyst. High methanol tolerance of the Pdâ€“Pt alloy catalysts could be attributed to the weak adsorption of methanol induced by the composition effect, to the presence of Pd atoms and to the formation of Pd-based alloys.

Preparation of Graphite Oxide Containing Different Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups and the Study of Ammonia Gas Sensitivity,Sensors,2018,"A series of graphite oxide samples were prepared using the modified Hummers method. Flake graphite was used as the raw material and the reaction temperature of the aqueous solution was changed (0 &#176;C, 30 &#176;C, 50 &#176;C, 60 &#176;C, 70 &#176;C, 80 &#176;C, and 100 &#176;C). X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectral analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and contact angle tests were performed to characterize the structure, chemical bonding, type, and content of oxygen-containing functional groups of the graphite oxide samples. The results showed that the type and content of each oxygen-containing functional group could be controlled by changing the reaction temperature with the addition of water. As the temperature of the system increased, the degree of oxidation of the graphite oxide samples first increased and then decreased. Too high a temperature (100 &#176;C) of the system led to the formation of epoxy groups by the decomposition of some hydroxyl groups in the samples, causing the reduction of oxygen-containing functional groups between the graphite layers, poor hydrophilic properties, and low moisture content. When the system temperature was 50 &#176;C, the interlayer spacing of the graphite oxide samples was at its highest, the graphite was completely oxidized (C/O = 1.85), and the oxygen-containing functional groups were mainly composed of hydroxyl groups (accounting for approximately 28.88% of the total oxygen-containing functional groups). The high content of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups had good hydrophilic ability and showed the highest moisture content. The sample at 50 &#176;C had better sensitivity to ammonia because of its high hydroxyl group and carboxyl group content, with the sample showing an excellent profile when the ammonia concentration was 20&#8315;60 ppm."
Oxygen reduction at platinum nanoparticles supported on carbon cryogel in alkaline solution,Journal of the Serbian Chemical Society,2007,"The oxygen reduction reaction was investigated in 0.1 M NaOH solution, on a porous coated electrode formed of Pt particles supported on carbon cryogel. The Pt/C catalyst was characterized by the X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and cyclic voltammetry techniques. The results demonstrated a successful reduction of Pt to metallic form and homogenous Pt particle size distribution with a mean particle size of about 2.7 nm. The ORR kinetics was investigated by linear sweep polarization at a rotating disc electrode. The results showed the existence of two E â€“ log j regions, usually referred to polycrystalline Pt in acid and alkaline solution. At low current densities (lcd), the Tafel slope was found to be close to â€“2.3RT/F, while at high current densities (hcd) it was found to be close to â€“2Ã—2.3RT/F. It is proposed that the main path in the ORR mechanism on Pt particles was the direct four-electron process, with the transfer of the first electron as the rate determining step. If the activities are expressed through the specific current densities, a small enhancement of the catalytic activity for Pt/C was observed compared to that of polycrystalline Pt. The effect of the Pt particle size on the electrocatalysis of oxygen reduction was ascribed to the predominant (111) facets of the platinum crystallites."
A new medium system containing sodium dodecyl sulfate suitable for studying superoxide and its reaction in aqueous solution,Electrochemistry Communications,2001,"Polarographic responses of the dissolved oxygen in phosphate (pH 7.4)-anion surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) medium were investigated by cyclic voltammetry and normal pulse voltammetry. The obtained results indicate that when the SDS concentration is up to 1.0Ã—10âˆ’4 mol/l there are three reduction waves corresponding to the following electrode processes of oxygen species: O2+eâ†’O2.âˆ’, O2.âˆ’+2HA+eâ†’H2O2+2Aâˆ’ and H2O2+2HA+2eâ†’2H2O+2Aâˆ’ (where HA presents proton donor), which is different from that in aqueous solution containing such surfactants as triphenylphosphine oxide or quinoline. This new medium system is available for studying the chemical reaction and kinetics of scavenging O2.âˆ’ by low molecular weight organic compounds and drugs, and was used to investigate the dismutation of O2âˆ’ catalyzed by tyrosine. The reaction rate constant of O2âˆ’ with tyrosine determined, 2.69Ã—104l/mol/s, is in agreement with that obtained by quenching chemiluminescence. The model of electric field concerned with the anion surfactant on electrode surface was proposed. It is suggested that there is, for SDS, an additional contribution to the inhibition of O2âˆ’ diffusion from the electrode towards bulk solution by the electric field in ion exchange layer formed by ionogenic groups of the adsorbed surfactant molecule, besides the anhydrous environment of electrode surface caused by adsorption of the anion surfactant.

Applications of lignin-derived catalysts for green synthesis,Green Energy & Environment,2019,"This review intends to introduce the application of lignin-derived catalyst for green organic synthesis over latest two decades and aims to present a renewable alternative for conventional catalyst for future industry application. The structure of lignin is initially introduced in this review. Then, various pretreatment and activation technologies of lignin are systematically presented, which includes physical activation for the formation of well-developed porosity and chemical activation to introduce catalytic active sites. Finally, the catalytic performances of various lignin-derived catalysts are rationally assessed and compared with conventional catalysts, which involves lignin-derived solid acids for hydrolysis, hydration, dehydration (trans)esterification, multi-component reaction and condensation, lignin-derived solid base for Knoevenagel reaction, lignin-derived electro-catalysts for electro-oxidation, oxygen reduction reaction, and lignin-derived supported transition metal catalysts for hydrogenation, oxidation, coupling reaction, tandem reaction, condensation reaction, ring-opening reaction, Friedel-Crafts-type reaction, Fischerâ€“Tropsch synthesis, click reaction, Glaser reaction, cycloaddition and (trans)esterification. The above lignin-derived catalysts thus successfully promote the transformations of organic compounds, carbon dioxide, biomass-based cellulose, saccharide and vegetable oil into valuable chemicals and fuels. At the end of this review, some perspectives are given on the current issues and tendency on the lignin-derived catalysts for green chemistry.

Metal Oxides Applied to Thermochemical Water-Splitting for Hydrogen Production Using Concentrated Solar Energy,ChemEngineering,2019,"Solar thermochemical processes have the potential to efficiently convert high-temperature solar heat into storable and transportable chemical fuels such as hydrogen. In such processes, the thermal energy required for the endothermic reaction is supplied by concentrated solar energy and the hydrogen production routes differ as a function of the feedstock resource. While hydrogen production should still rely on carbonaceous feedstocks in a transition period, thermochemical water-splitting using metal oxide redox reactions is considered to date as one of the most attractive methods in the long-term to produce renewable H<sub>2</sub> for direct use in fuel cells or further conversion to synthetic liquid hydrocarbon fuels. The two-step redox cycles generally consist of the endothermic solar thermal reduction of a metal oxide releasing oxygen with concentrated solar energy used as the high-temperature heat source for providing reaction enthalpy; and the exothermic oxidation of the reduced oxide with H<sub>2</sub>O to generate H<sub>2</sub>. This approach requires the development of redox-active and thermally-stable oxide materials able to split water with both high fuel productivities and chemical conversion rates. The main relevant two-step metal oxide systems are commonly based on volatile (ZnO/Zn, SnO<sub>2</sub>/SnO) and non-volatile redox pairs (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/FeO, ferrites, CeO<sub>2</sub>/CeO<sub>2&#8722;&#948;</sub>, perovskites). These promising hydrogen production cycles are described by providing an overview of the best performing redox systems, with special focus on their capabilities to produce solar hydrogen with high yields, rapid reaction rates, and thermochemical performance stability, and on the solar reactor technologies developed to operate the solid&#8722;gas reaction systems."
Onion-like graphitic nanoshell structured Feâ€“N/C nanofibers derived from electrospinning for oxygen reduction reaction in acid media,Electrochemistry Communications,2013,"Hollow onion-like graphitic nanoshell structured Feâ€“N/C nanofiber (Feâ€“N/CNF) catalyst with porous morphology was prepared by heat treating as-spun polyacrylonitrile/ferrous oxalate composite nanofibers in ammonia atmosphere for the first time. These porous electrocatalyst showed both excellent catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and much better stability than commercial Pt/C catalyst in acid solution.

Towards Highly Performing and Stable PtNi Catalysts in Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells for Automotive Application,Materials,2017,"In order to help the introduction on the automotive market of polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs), it is mandatory to develop highly performing and stable catalysts. The main objective of this work is to investigate PtNi/C catalysts in a PEFC under low relative humidity and pressure conditions, more representative of automotive applications. Carbon supported PtNi nanoparticles were prepared by reduction of metal precursors with formic acid and successive thermal and leaching treatments. The effect of the chemical composition, structure and surface characteristics of the synthesized samples on their electrochemical behavior was investigated. The catalyst characterized by a larger Pt content (Pt3Ni2/C) presented the highest catalytic activity (lower potential losses in the activation region) among the synthesized bimetallic PtNi catalysts and the commercial Pt/C, used as the reference material, after testing at high temperature (95 Â°C) and low humidification (50%) conditions for automotive applications, showing a cell potential (ohmic drop-free) of 0.82 V at 500 mAÂ·cmâˆ’2. In order to assess the electro-catalysts stability, accelerated degradation tests were carried out by cycling the cell potential between 0.6 V and 1.2 V. By comparing the electrochemical and physico-chemical parameters at the beginning of life (BoL) and end of life (EoL), it was demonstrated that the Pt1Ni1/C catalyst was the most stable among the catalyst series, with only a 2% loss of voltage at 200 mAÂ·cmâˆ’2 and 12.5% at 950 mAÂ·cmâˆ’2. However, further improvements are needed to produce durable catalysts."
On the Influence of Composition and Structure of Carbon-Supported Pt-SnO<sub>2</sub> Hetero-Clusters onto Their Electrocatalytic Activity and Durability in PEMFC,Catalysts,2019,"A detailed study of the structure, morphology and electrochemical properties of Pt/C and Pt/x-SnO<sub>2</sub>/C catalysts synthesized using a polyol method has been provided. A series of catalysts supported on the SnO<sub>2</sub>-modified carbon was synthesized and studied by various methods including transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electrochemical methods, and fuel cell testing. The SnO<sub>2</sub> content varies from 5 to 40 wt %. The TEM images, XRD and XPS analysis suggested the Pt-SnO<sub>2</sub> hetero-clusters formation. The SnO<sub>2</sub> content of ca. 10% ensures an optimal catalytic layer structure and morphology providing uniform distribution of Pt-SnO<sub>2</sub> clusters over the carbon support surface. Pt/10wt %-SnO<sub>2</sub>/C catalyst demonstrates increased activity and durability toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in course of accelerated stress testing due to the high stability of SnO<sub>2</sub> and its interaction with Pt. The polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell current&#8722;voltage performance of the Pt/10wt %-SnO<sub>2</sub>/C is comparable with those of Pt/C, however, higher durability is expected."
Nitrogen-Doped Hollow Carbon Spheres with Embedded Co Nanoparticles as Active Non-Noble-Metal Electrocatalysts for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction,C,2018,"Transition metal (Fe, Co, Ni) complexes on carbon nanomaterials are promising candidates as electrocatalysts towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). In this paper, nitrogen-doped hollow carbon spheres with embedded Co nanoparticles were successfully prepared via a controllable synthesis strategy. The morphology characterization shows that the hollow carbon spheres possess an average diameter of ~150 nm with a narrow size distribution and a shell thickness of ~14.5 nm. The content of N doping ranges from 2.1 to 6.6 at.% depending on the calcination temperature from 900 to 1050 Â°C. Compared with commercial Pt/C, the Co-containing nitrogen-doped hollow carbon spheres prepared at 900 Â°C (CoNHCS-900) as an ORR electrocatalyst shows a half-wave potential shift of only âˆ†E1/2 = 55 mV, but a superior stability of about 90.2% maintenance after 20,000 s in the O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH at a rotating speed of 1600 rpm. This could be ascribed to the synergistic effects of N-containing moieties, Co-Nx species, and Co nanoparticles, which significantly increase the density of active sites and promote the charge transfer during the ORR process."
A Review: Role of oxidative stress in male infertility,Journal of Fasa University of Medical Sciences,2013,"Recent studies have shown that reactive oxygen species (ROS) have a very important role in the intracellular signaling process in physiological conditions. On the other hand, during the recent decade it has been indicated that ROS play a role in various types of male infertility and it is due to the overproduction of ROS or decrease in the antioxidant defense system in the reproductive system and sperm. In pathological conditions, ROS via interferences in the spermatogenesis process, sperm function, and sperm structure (motility, viability, acrosome reaction, sperm-oocyte fusion, and damage to DNA and cell membrane) as well as reduction in fertilization and implantation can lead to infertility. Knowledge of how ROS affect the physiological process of the reproductive system is crucial in the treatment of infertility. Thus, in this review article we will discuss experimental and clinical findings related to the effects of ROS on male fertility. "
Exogenous melatonin improves salt tolerance in tomato by regulating photosynthetic electron flux and the ascorbateâ€“glutathione cycle,Journal of Plant Interactions,2019,"Melatonin (MT) can protect plants against abiotic stress. In order to explore whether melatonin can improve photosynthetic function under NaCl stress, Solanum lycopersicum L. cv. Liaoyuanduoli were exposed to 150â€…mmolâ€…Lâˆ’1 NaCl stress with or without pretreatment with 150â€…Î_molâ€…Lâˆ’1 melatonin. The results showed that NaCl stress can lead to reduced chlorophyll content, lower photosynthetic function, increased reaction oxygen species (ROS) levels, and decreased PSII activity. These changes were mainly due to the reduction in oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) activity on the donor side of PSII and the blockage of electron transfer from QA to QB on receptor side of PSII. The donor side of PSII was more sensitive to NaCl stress relative to the receptor side of PSII. Interestingly, application of MT enhanced tomato NaCl tolerance. MT reduced the production of ROS by balancing the distribution of photosynthetic electron flux, facilitated the repair of PSII by maintaining the abundance of Psb O and D1, and promoting the ability of the donor and acceptor sides of PSII to deliver electrons. MT also enhanced the scavenging ability of ROS by stimulating the activity of enzymes involved in the AsA-GSH cycle."
Substrate Crossover Effect and Performance Regeneration of the Biofouled Rotating Air-Cathode in Microbial Fuel Cell,Frontiers in Energy Research,2018,"In case of conventional two-dimensional air-cathodes in microbial fuel cells, biofouling usually covers the catalytic-layer side after a long-term operation and results in performance decrease mainly by obstructing the transfer of OHâˆ’ ions. This study on a biofouled three-dimensional rotating air-cathode (bio-RAC), demonstrates that besides the OHâˆ’ effect, substrate crossover acts as a key hindrance to the air-cathode performance. MFC operation and cyclic voltammogram results revealed that about 35% performance decrease of the bio-RAC performance was caused by the obstruction of oxygen and OHâˆ’ transfer. It decreased further by 26.8 and 52.7% in the presence of 3 and 10 mM acetate, respectively, thereby clearly suggesting the impact of substrate crossover on the oxygen reduction reaction at the bio-RAC. In particular, high substrate concentrations exceeded the effect caused by obstruction of oxygen and OHâˆ’ transfer on the oxygen reduction catalysis. A simple approach of applying a high-speed rotation of about 500 rpm to the biofouled air cathode was proved to be able to recover 85% of the initial performance of the bio-RAC."

Carbon dots (C-d) were first synthesized via hydrothermal treatment of soy milk. Then, cobalt (II) nitrate was incorporated with C-d via heat treatment to generate nitrogen and cobalt codoped carbon composites (Co/C). When polypyrrole was introduced in the synthetic process, carbon composites with higher nitrogen and cobalt contents (Co/N/C) than Co/C were obtained, which exhibited high electrocatalytic activity, excellent methanol crossover effect, and good stability toward ORR in alkaline solutions.

Kinetics of pellet reduced by H<sub>2</sub> and the mixture of CO and H<sub>2</sub> ,Metalurgija,2018,"Canadian hematite acid pellet with low magnetite and olivine contents were isothermally reduced by hydrogen and carbon monoxide at 600 to 1 000 Â°C. Pellet reduction was investigated by a thermo gravimetric analysis measuring oxygen weight loss as a function of time. Then macroscopic and microscopic examinations, X-ray and carbon analyses were also used to elucidate the mechanisms of pellet reduction. Activation energy is around 27 kJ/mol for H<sub>2</sub> atmospheres and is about 15 kJ/mol for the mixture of H<sub>2</sub> and CO. Carbon producing from CO disproportionation reaction performs a catalyzer at the final reduction of pellet."
Heterogeneous Bimetallic Cuâ€“Ni Nanoparticle-Supported Catalysts in the Selective Oxidation of Benzyl Alcohol to Benzaldehyde,Catalysts,2019,"Three bimetallic Cu&#8722;Ni nanoparticle-supported catalysts were synthesized by co-immobilization followed by H<sub>2</sub> reduction. A chromium(III) terephthalate metal organic framework (MIL-101), titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>), and carbon (C) with different properties (acidity and Brunauer&#8722;Emmett&#8722;Teller surface area) were selected as supports for studying the effect of the support nature on the catalytic activity and selectivity in the oxidation of benzyl alcohol. The physicochemical properties of the Cu&#8722;Ni-supported catalysts were characterized by XRD, NH<sub>3</sub>-TPD, nitrogen adsorption/desorption, TEM, EDS, XPS, and ICP-OES. Bimetallic Cu&#8722;Ni nanoparticles were highly dispersed on the support. The catalytic activities of CuNi/MIL-101, CuNi/TiO<sub>2</sub>, and CuNi/C were tested in the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde in the presence of molecular oxygen under mild reaction conditions. The highest benzaldehyde yields were achieved with CuNi/TiO<sub>2</sub>, CuNi/MIL-101, and CuNi/C catalysts at 100 &#176;C within 4 h under 5, 3, and 3 bar of O<sub>2</sub>, respectively. The bimetallic Cu&#8722;Ni-supported catalysts possessed two types of catalytic active sites: acid sites and bimetallic Cu&#8722;Ni nanoparticles. The CuNi/MIL-101 catalyst possessed a high number of acid sites and exhibited high yield during selective benzyl alcohol oxidation to benzaldehyde. Importantly, the catalysts exhibited a high functional group (electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups) tolerance. Cu&#8722;Ni-supported catalysts with an Cu:Ni mole ratio of 1:1 exhibited the highest yield of 47% for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde. Reusability and leaching experiment results exhibited that CuNi/MIL-101 showed better stability than CuNi/TiO<sub>2</sub> and CuNi/C catalysts due to the large porous cavities of MIL-101 support; these cavities can be used to trap bimetallic Cu&#8722;Ni nanoparticles and inhibit nanoparticle leaching."
2D MOF Nanoflake-Assembled Spherical Microstructures for Enhanced Supercapacitor and Electrocatalysis Performances,Nano-Micro Letters,2017,"Abstract Metalâ€“organic frameworks (MOFs) are of great interest as potential electrochemically active materials. However, few studies have been conducted into understanding whether control of the shape and components of MOFs can optimize their electrochemical performances due to the rational realization of their shapes. Component control of MOFs remains a significant challenge. Herein, we demonstrate a solvothermal method to realize nanostructure engineering of 2D nanoflake MOFs. The hollow structures with Ni/Co- and Ni-MOF (denoted as Ni/Co-MOF nanoflakes and Ni-MOF nanoflakes) were assembled for their electrochemical performance optimizations in supercapacitors and in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). As a result, the Ni/Co-MOF nanoflakes exhibited remarkably enhanced performance with a specific capacitance of 530.4Â FÂ gâˆ’1 at 0.5Â AÂ gâˆ’1 in 1Â M LiOH aqueous solution, much higher than that of Ni-MOF (306.8Â FÂ gâˆ’1) and ZIF-67 (168.3Â FÂ gâˆ’1), a good rate capability, and a robust cycling performance with no capacity fading after 2000 cycles. Ni/Co-MOF nanoflakes also showed improved electrocatalytic performance for the ORR compared to Ni-MOF and ZIF-67. The present work highlights the significant role of tuning 2D nanoflake ensembles of Ni/Co-MOF in accelerating electron and charge transportation for optimizing energy storage and conversion devices."
Hemoglobin oxygen affinity in patients with cystic fibrosis.,PLoS ONE,2014,"In patients with cystic fibrosis lung damages cause arterial hypoxia. As a typical compensatory reaction one might expect changes in oxygen affinity of hemoglobin. Therefore position (standard half saturation pressure P50st) and slope (Hill's n) of the O2 dissociation curve as well as the Bohr coefficients (BC) for CO2 and lactic acid were determined in blood of 14 adult patients (8 males, 6 females) and 14 healthy controls (6 males, 8 females). While Hill's n amounted to approximately 2.6 in all subjects, P50st was slightly increased by 1 mmHg in both patient groups (controls male 26.7 Â± 0.2, controls female 27.0 Â± 0.1, patients male 27.7 Â± 0.5, patients female 28.0 Â± 0.3 mmHg; mean and standard error, overall p<0.01). Main cause was a rise of 1-2 Âµmol/g hemoglobin in erythrocytic 2,3-biphosphoglycerate concentration. One patient only, clearly identified as an outlier and with the mutation G551D, showed a reduction of both P50st (24.5 mmHg) and [2,3-biphosphoglycerate] (9.8 Âµmol/g hemoglobin). There were no differences in BCCO2, but small sex differences in the BC for lactic acid in the controls which were not detectable in the patients. Causes for the right shift of the O2 dissociation curve might be hypoxic stimulation of erythrocytic glycolysis and an increased red cell turnover both causing increased [2,3-biphosphoglycerate]. However, for situations with additional hypercapnia as observed in exercising patients a left shift seems to be a more favourable adaptation in cystic fibrosis. Additionally when in vivo PO2 values were corrected to the standard conditions they mostly lay left of the in vitro O2 dissociation curve in both patients and controls. This hints to unknown fugitive factors influencing oxygen affinity."
Development of porous Pt/IrO2/carbon paper electrocatalysts with enhanced mass transport as oxygen electrodes in unitized regenerative fuel cells,Electrochemistry Communications,2016,"The oxygen electrodes in unitized regenerative fuel cells (URFC) must have high activities towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) as well as oxygen evolution reaction (OER), thus requiring high loading of noble metal electrocatalysts. In this study, porous Pt/IrO2/carbon paper (CP) electrocatalysts were developed to reduce the metal loading. The Pt/IrO2/CP electrodes were fabricated by sequential formation of IrO2 layers (loading 0.1Â mgÂ cmâˆ’2) and porous Pt layers (0â€“0.3Â mgÂ cmâˆ’2) on CP substrates by electrodeposition and spraying techniques, respectively. The fuel cell (FC) performances increased linearly up to 0.69Â AÂ cmâˆ’2 with increasing Pt loading (up to ~0.3Â mgÂ cmâˆ’2) at 0.6Â V, whereas the water electrolysis (WE) activity was highest at Pt loading of 0.2Â mgÂ cmâˆ’2. The current densities in the FC and WE modes and round-trip efficiency of the developed Pt/IrO2/CP electrodes with the oxygen electrocatalysts loadings of 0.3 and 0.4Â mgÂ cmâˆ’2 were higher or comparable to previously reported values with higher loading (1.5â€“4.0Â mgÂ cmâˆ’2). These high performances with low loading are probably due to the facile oxygen and water transport through well-developed macropores originating from the open CP structures, providing effective utilization of the IrO2 and Pt electrocatalysts towards OER and ORR, respectively.

1.2Â Volt manganese oxide symmetric supercapacitor,Electrochemistry Communications,2011,"Capacitance fading of MnO2 supercapacitor electrode under negative polarization below 0.0Â V (versus Ag/AgCl/sat. KCl(aq)) arises from extensive reduction of Mn(IV) to form inactive Mn(II) species, and this has typically limited the operating voltage window of an aqueous symmetric MnO2 supercapacitor to be no greater than 0.8Â V. As this lower potential limit is close to the onset potential of MnO2-catalyzed oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), the fading problem can be alleviated by effectively passing the accumulated electrons in the oxide electrode to the dissolved oxygen molecules in electrolyte in order to avoid the formation of the surface Mn(II) species. This has been demonstrated by either increasing the dissolved oxygen content or using the Ti(IV)/Ti(III) redox couple in the electrolyte as a charge-transfer mediator to enhance the electrocatalytic activity of MnO2 for ORR. Therefore, a MnO2 symmetric supercapacitor showing remarkable cycling stability over an operating voltage window of 1.2Â V has been achieved by using Ti(IV)-containing neutral electrolyte (1Â M KCl(aq)).

A Hybrid Na//K+-Containing Electrolyte//O2 Battery with High Rechargeability and Cycle Stability,Research,2019,"Na-O2 and K-O2 batteries have attracted extensive attention in recent years. However, the parasitic reactions involving the discharge product of NaO2 or K anode with electrolytes and the severe Na or K dendrites plague their rechargeability and cycle stability. Herein, we report a hybrid Na//K+-containing electrolyte//O2 battery consisting of a Na anode, 1.0 M of potassium triflate in diglyme, and a porous carbon cathode. Upon discharging, KO2 is preferentially produced via oxygen reduction in the cathode with Na+ stripped from the Na anode, and reversely, the KO2 is electrochemically decomposed with Na+ plated back onto the anode. The new reaction pathway can circumvent the parasitic reactions involving instable NaO2 and active K anode, and alternatively, the good stability and conductivity of KO2 and stable Na stripping/plating in the presence of K+ enable the hybrid battery to exhibit an average discharge/charge voltage gap of 0.15 V, high Coulombic efficiency of >96%, and superior cycling stability of 120 cycles. This will pave a new pathway to promote metal-air batteries."

Methanol-Tolerant Mâ€“Nâ€“C Catalysts for Oxygen Reduction Reactions in Acidic Media and Their Application in Direct Methanol Fuel Cells,Catalysts,2018,"Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) are emerging technologies for the electrochemical conversion of the chemical energy of a fuel (methanol) directly into electrical energy, with a low environmental impact and high efficiency. Yet, before this technology can reach a large-scale diffusion, specific issues must be solved, in particular, the high cost of the cell components. In a direct methanol fuel cell system, high capital costs are mainly derived from the use of noble metal catalysts; therefore, the development of low-cost electro-catalysts, satisfying the target requirements of high performance and durability, represents an important challenge. The research is currently addressed to the development of metal&#8315;nitrogen&#8315;carbon (M&#8315;N&#8315;C) materials as cheap and sustainable catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in an acid environment, for application in polymer electrolyte fuel cells fueled by hydrogen or alcohol.

Oxygen Reduction Activity and Stability of Composite Pdx/Co-Nanofilms/C Electrocatalysts in Acid and Alkaline Media,Frontiers in Chemistry,2018,"The morphology tuning of Pd and Pd-M nanoparticles is one of the significant strategies to control the catalytic activity toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). In this study, composite Pdx/Co-nanofilms/C electrocatalysts of Pd nanoparticles implanted onto Co nanofilms were synthesized on an immiscible ionic liquid (IL)/water interface for ORR. The Pd nanoparticles implanted onto Co nanofilms show a marked distortion of crystal lattice and surface roughness. These Pdx/Co-nanofilms/C electrocatalysts exhibit enhanced activity for ORR compared with Pd/C and PdxCo/C catalysts in both acid and alkaline solutions, in which the Pd3/Co-nanofilms/C catalyst displays the highest ORR mass activity. The superior ORR mass activities of the fabricated Pdx/Co-nanofilms/C catalysts may be mainly attributed to their larger catalytic areas, which are conferred by the rough surface of Pd nanoparticles with a distorted crystal lattice, and the synergistic effect between the surface Pd atoms and the 2D Co nanofilm substrate. The relationship between ORR mass activity and Pd/Co atom ratio varies in different electrolytes. Furthermore, by using proper heat-treatment methods, the Pdx/Co-nanofilms/C catalysts exhibit improved cycling stability compared with pure Pd/C catalyst after extended potential cycling."
Recent Advances in Oxygen Electrocatalysts Based on Perovskite Oxides,Nanomaterials,2019,"Electrochemical oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution are two key processes that limit the efficiency of important energy conversion devices such as metal&#8722;air battery and electrolysis.

"Modeling the OEC with Two New Biomimetic Models: Preparations, Structural Characterization, and Water Photolysis Studies of a Baâ€“Mn Box Type Complex and a Mn4N6 Planar-Diamond Cluster",Catalysts,2018,"The oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) is the native enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of water in natural photosynthesis. Two new classes of manganese cluster complexes of formula Ba2Mn2L12(H3L1)2(CH3OH)4 1 and Mn4L26Cl2 2 were prepared (H4L1 = N,N&prime;-(ethane-1,2-diyl)bis(2-hydroxybenzamide); L2 = methyl picolinimidate) and characterized by standard techniques including microanalysis, IR spectroscopy, ESI spectrometry, and magnetic susceptibility measurements. X-ray diffraction studies of these complexes revealed (i) a box-type structure for 1 formed by two redox-active manganese(III) ions and two barium(II) ions connected by two bridging bisamido-bisphenoxy ligand molecules; and (ii) a planar-diamond array for Mn4N6 cluster 2 where the picolinimidates act as chelating ligands through the two nitrogen atoms. The ability of 1 and 2 to split water has been studied by means of water photolysis experiments. In these experiments, the oxygen evolution was measured in aqueous media in the presence of p-benzoquinone (acting as the hydrogen acceptor), the reduction of which was followed by UV-spectroscopy. The relevant photolytic activity found for 1 is in contrast to the inactivity of 2 in the photolytic experiments. This different behavior is discussed on the basis of the structure of the biomimetic models and the proposed reaction mechanism for this process supported by DFT calculations."
"Na+, K+-ATPase and Ca2+, Mg2+-ATPase activity in spermatozoa of infertile men with different forms of pathospermia",_‘Ñ–___»____Ñ–Ñ‡__Ñ– ÑÅÑ‚Ñƒ_´Ñ–Ñ—,2017,"Ion-exchanging ATPases play an essential role in biology of spermatozoa, incluÂ_ding their motility, hyperactivation, chemotaxis, acrosome reaction etc. The aim of present study was to analyze Na+, K+-ATPase and Ca2+, Mg2+-ATPase activities in spermatozoa of the infertile men with different forms of pathospermia and to explore a possible role that they may play in male infertility. A significant reduction in ouabain-sensitive Na+, K+-ATPase activity in sperm cells of infertile men with oligozoo-, asthenozoo-, oligoasthenozoo- and leucocytospermia was shown. The results show that asthenozoo-, oligoasthenozoo- and leucocytospermic patients have significantly impaired thapsigargin-sensitive and thapsigargin-insensitive Ca2+, Mg2+-ATPase activity compared to healthy men. However, Ca2+, Mg2+-ATPase activity has a tendency to increase in patients with oligozoospermia. The depressed ATPase activity in the infertile men could be due to a reduction in intracellular adenosine triphosphate level and damage of spermal membranes caused by lipid peroxidation products. The most significant decrease in Ca2+, Mg2+-ATPase activity was observed in patients  with leucocytospermia which could be explained by an excessive formation of the reactive oxygen species by the leucocytes. It is suggested that a decrease in the ion-exchanging ATPase activity may damage sperm functions and be one of possible causes of male infertility."
Reduced graphene oxide supported PdNi alloy nanocrystals for the oxygen reduction and methanol oxidation reactions,Green Energy & Environment,2018,"The research on electrocatalysts with relatively lower price than Pt and excellent electrocatalytic performance for the cathode oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and anode methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) is vital for the development of direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs). In this work, we develop a cyanogel-reduction method to synthesize reduced graphene oxide (rGO) supported highly dispersed PdNi alloy nanocrystals (PdNi/rGO) with high alloying degree and tunable Pd/Ni ratio. The large specific surface area and the d-band center downshift of Pd result in excellent activity of Pd4Ni1/rGO nanohybrids for the ORR. The modification of Pd electronic structure can facilitate the adsorption of CH3OH on Pd surface and the highly oxophilic property of Ni can eliminate/mitigate the COads intermediates poisoning, which make PdNi/rGO nanohybrids possess superior MOR activity. In addition, rGO improve the stability of PdNi alloy nanocrystals for the ORR and MOR. Due to high activity and stability for the ORR and MOR, PdNi/rGO nanohybrids are promising to be an available bifunctional electrocatalyst in DMFCs.

Effect of lithium ions on oxygen reduction in ionic liquid-based electrolytes,Electrochemistry Communications,2011,"The effect of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) on the oxygen redox reaction (ORR) in several pyrrolidinium-based ionic liquids (ILs) is investigated by cyclic voltammetry. The results are compared to those found with LiTFSI-tetraglyme and LiTFSI-1,3-dimethyl-3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2(1H)-pyrimidone solutions. The effect of the addition of tris(pentafluorophenyl) borane (TPFPB) to IL-LiTFSI solutions is also investigated. The results demonstrate that the presence of 0.1Â M Li+ renders the ORR similar in the investigated ILs, lowers the reduction voltammetric currents and makes ORR electrochemically irreversible. The addition of TPFPB to IL-TFSI solutions favours the solubility of oxygen-based products of Li+ and should positively affect the performance of IL-based lithium-air batteries.

Structural effects on the enhancement of ORR activity on Pt single-crystal electrodes modified with alkylamines,Electrochemistry Communications,2018,"We have studied Pt surfaces for which activity towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is enhanced by adsorbed amines: octylamine (OA) and an alkyl amine containing a pyrene ring (PA). Adsorbed OA/PA (molar ratio 9/1) enhances activity for ORR on n(111)â€“(111) surfaces of Pt for terrace atomic rows n greater than 7. The activity on Pt(111), the surface of which is a flat terrace, is particularly enhanced. On Pt(100), which also has a flat terrace, however, the ORR activity is greatly reduced. It is shown that adsorbed OA/PA enhances the ORR on surfaces with a wide (111) terrace, but deactivates the ORR on the (100) terrace.

Preparation of Nanoporous PdIrZn Alloy Catalyst by Dissolving Excess ZnO for Cathode of High- Temperature Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cells,Energies,2019,"Carbon-supported nanoporous palladium-iridium&#8722;zinc (NP-PdIrZn) electrocatalyst was prepared through the modification of the alcohol-reduction process following the selective dissolution of excess ZnO nanoparticles using NaOH solution. The electrocatalyst was applied successfully to the cathode for a high-temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (HT-PEMFC). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the NP-PdIrZn nanoparticles suggests formation of the ternary alloy and complete removal of ZnO without the formation of individual Pd, Ir, or Zn nanoparticles. Moreover, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images displayed porous nanoparticles with an irregular shape, which was generated by removing the ZnO from the PdIrZn&#8722;ZnO nanocomposites, and was prepared by using the excessive Zn precursor. The electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of the NP-PdIrZn catalysts was estimated by cyclic voltammetry using a rotating disk electrode method , and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity was evaluated by a linear sweep method. The NP-PdIrZn catalysts showed larger ECSA and higher ORR activity than those of the PdIr and PdIrZn catalysts, which may be attributed to the increased exposed surface area by selective etching of the ZnO in the composites. Furthermore, the NP-PdIrZn catalyst exhibited excellent performance (0.66 V) in a single cell under the HT-PEMFC condition than those of the PdIr (0.58 V) and PdIrZn (0.62 V) catalysts, indicating that geometric and electronic control of Pd-based alloy can improve the single-cell performance for the HT-PEMFC."
Improved electrocatalytic effect of carbon nanomaterials by covalently anchoring with CoTAPP via diazonium salt reactions,Electrochemistry Communications,2012,"Cobalt[tetrakis(o-aminophenyl)porphyrin] (CoTAPP) was covalently anchored (CA) onto the surface of three carbon nanomaterials (CNMs; graphene, single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT), and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT)) via diazonium salt reactions, which is a simple and effective method to improve the electrocatalytic activity of CoTAPP for combination with CNMs. The electrocatalytic reduction of O2 on glassy carbon electrodes (GCEs) modified with these CoTAPP-anchored CNMs established a pathway of four-electron transfer reductions to H2O.

Modeling of Three-Way Catalyst Dynamics for a Compressed Natural Gas Engine during Leanâ€“Rich Transitions,Applied Sciences,2019,"The main objective of the present research activity was to investigate the effect of very fast composition transitions of the engine exhaust typical in real-world driving operating conditions, as fuel cutoff phases or engine misfire, on the aftertreatment devices, which are generally very sensitive to these changes. This phenomenon is particularly evident when dealing with engines powered by natural gas, which requires the use of a three-way catalyst (TWC). Indeed, some deviations from the stoichiometric lambda value can interfere with the catalytic converter efficiency. In this work, a numerical &#8220;quasi-steady&#8221; model was developed to simulate the chemical and transport phenomena of a specific TWC for a compressed natural gas (CNG) heavy-duty engine. A dedicated experimental campaign was performed in order to evaluate the catalyst response to a defined &#955; variation pattern of the engine exhaust stream, thus providing the data necessary for the numerical model validation. Tests were carried out to reproduce oxygen storage phenomena that make catalyst behavior different from the classic steady-state operating conditions. A surface reaction kinetic mechanism concerning CH<sub>4</sub>, CO, H<sub>2</sub>, oxidation and NO reduction has been appropriately calibrated at different &#955; values with a step-by-step procedure, both in steady-state conditions of the engine work plan and during transient conditions, through cyclical and consecutive transitions of variable frequency between rich and lean phases. The activity also includes a proper calibration of the reactions involving cerium inside the catalyst in order to reproduce oxygen storage and release dynamics. Sensitivity analysis and continuous control of the reaction rate allowed evaluating the impact of each of them on the exhaust composition in several operating conditions. The proposed model predicts tailpipe conversion/formation of the main chemical species, starting from experimental engine-out data, and provides a useful tool to evaluate the catalyst&#8217;s performance."

In addition, gp 120 reduced both glutamine concentration in astroglial cell supernatants and GS expression as detected by immunocytochemistry and western blotting analysis. Pre-treatment of cells with NAC (0.5â€“5 mM), dose-dependently antagonised astroglial apoptotic cell death induced by gp 120, an effect accompanied by significant attenuation of MDA accumulation.

The Roles of Graphene and Ag in the Hybrid ,[emailÂ protected],2018," with 2.5 wt% graphene presented the highest activity among all the prepared composite photocatalysts. The coupling of graphene and Ag0 increased the photocatalyticactivity and stability of pure Ag2O. Under higher SMX concentrations, the adsorption, not the photocatalytic ability, playeda crucial role during the SMX removal process. On the basis of the characterization and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging experiments, a separation and transfer mechanism of photogenerated carriers was proposed. In the photocatalytic degradation of SMX, the major active species wereidentified as photogenerated holes; photogenerated electrons in the conduction band (CB) of Ag2O could not transfer to graphene through Ag0due to the more negative reduction potential of graphene. This is an important result regardinggraphene and Ag0 roles which isdifferent from that for the photocatalytic degradation of dyes. This researchmay provide new insights into photocatalytic processes for the degradation of non-dye pollutants bycomposite materials to guidethe design of highly efficient reaction systems."
"Platinum monolayer electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction: effect of substrates, and long-term stability",Journal of the Serbian Chemical Society,2005,"We describe a novel concept for a Ptmonolayer electrocatalyst and present the results of our electrochemical, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and scanning tunneling microscopy studies. The electrocatalysts were prepared by a new method for depositing Pt monolayers involving the galvanic displacement by Pt of an underpotentially deposited Cu monolayer on substrates of Au (111), Ir(111), Pd(111), Rh(111) and Ru(0001) single crylstals, and Pd nanoparticles. The kinetics of O2 reduction showed significant enhancement with Pt monolayers on Pd(111) and Pd nanoparticle surfaces in comparisonwith the reaction on Pt(111) and Pt nanoparticles, respectively. This increase in catalytic activity is attributed partly to the decreased formation of PtOH, as shown by in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The results illustrate that placing a Pt monolayer on a suitable substrate of metal nanoparticles is an attractive way of designing better O2 reduction electrocatalysts with very low Pt contents."

Variation of iron redox kinetics and its relation with molecular composition of standard humic substances at circumneutral pH.,PLoS ONE,2017,"Oxidation and reduction kinetics of iron (Fe) and proportion of steady-state Fe(II) concentration relative to total dissolved Fe (steady-state Fe(II) fraction) were investigated in the presence of various types of standard humic substances (HS) with particular emphasis on the photochemical and thermal reduction of Fe(III) and oxidation of Fe(II) by dissolved oxygen (O2) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) at circumneutral pH (pH 7-8). Rates of Fe(III) reduction were spectrophotometrically determined by a ferrozine method under the simulated sunlight and dark conditions, whereas rates of Fe(II) oxidation were examined in air-saturated solution using luminol chemiluminescence technique. The reduction and oxidation rate constants were determined to substantially vary depending on the type of HS. For example, the first-order rate constants varied by up to 10-fold for photochemical reduction and 7-fold for thermal reduction. The degree of variation in Fe(II) oxidation was larger for the H2O2-mediated reaction compared to the O2-mediated reaction (e.g., 15- and 3-fold changes for the former and latter reactions, respectively, at pH 8). The steady-state Fe(II) fraction under the simulated sunlight indicated that the Fe(II) fraction varies by up to 12-fold. The correlation analysis indicated that variation of Fe(II) oxidation is significantly associated with aliphatic content of HS, suggesting that Fe(II) complexation by aliphatic components accelerates Fe(II) oxidation. The reduction rate constant and steady-state Fe(II) fractions in the presence of sunlight had relatively strong positive relations with free radical content of HS, possibly due to the reductive property of radical semiquinone in HS. Overall, the findings in this study indicated that the Fe reduction and oxidation kinetics and resultant Fe(II) formation are substantially influenced by chemical properties of HS."
Synthesis and Characterization of Carbon/Nitrogen/Iron Based Nanoparticles by Laser Pyrolysis as Non-Noble Metal Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Reduction,C,2018,"This paper reports original results on the synthesis of Carbon/Nitrogen/Iron-based Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts by CO2 laser pyrolysis. Precursors consisted of two different liquid mixtures containing FeOOH nanoparticles or iron III acetylacetonate as iron precursors, being fed to the reactor as an aerosol of liquid droplets. Carbon and nitrogen were brought by pyridine or a mixture of pyridine and ethanol depending on the iron precursor involved. The use of ammonia as laser energy transfer agent also provided a potential nitrogen source. For each liquid precursor mixture, several syntheses were conducted through the step-by-step modification of NH3 flow volume fraction, so-called R parameter. We found that various feature such as the synthesis production yield or the nanomaterial iron and carbon content, showed identical trends as a function of R for each liquid precursor mixture. The obtained nanomaterials consisted in composite nanostructures in which iron based nanoparticles are, to varying degrees, encapsulated by a presumably nitrogen doped carbon shell. Combining X-ray diffraction and Mossbauer spectroscopy with acid leaching treatment and extensive XPS surface analysis allowed the difficult question of the nature of the formed iron phases to be addressed. Besides metal and carbide iron phases, data suggest the formation of iron nitride phase at high R values. Interestingly, electrochemical measurements reveal that the higher R the higher the onset potential for the ORR, what suggests the need of iron-nitride phase existence for the formation of active sites towards the ORR."
Why Is Water More Reactive Than Hydrogen in Photocatalytic CO2 Conversion at Higher Pressures? Elucidation by Means of X-Ray Absorption Fine Structure and Gas Chromatographyâ€“Mass Spectrometry,Frontiers in Chemistry,2018,"Photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into mainly methane using Pd/TiO2 photocatalyst proceeded faster at 0.80 MPa using water rather than hydrogen as a reductant. The former reaction (CO2 + water) consists of two steps: first, water photosplitting and second, the latter reaction (CO2 + hydrogen). It was paradoxical that total steps proceeded faster than each step based on simple kinetics. To elucidate the reason, Pd and Ti K-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) was monitored during CO2 photoconversion using H2 or moisture and the exchange reaction of 13CO2 at Pd/TiO2 surface was also monitored. As a result, the coordination number, N(Tiâ€“O) and N[Ti(â€“Oâ€“)Ti] values, decreased from original values for TiO2 crystalline (6 and 12) to 4.9â€“5.7 and 9.7â€“10.6 under CO2 and moisture, respectively, in contrast to significantly smaller decreases under CO2 and H2 and under Ar. The exchange of gas-phase 13CO2 with preadsorbed 12CO2 reached the equilibrium in ~20 h with a rate constant of 0.20 hâˆ’1. The reason of the higher activity using water rather than H2 could be explained owing to the oxygen vacancy (Ov) sites as confirmed by XAFS. The reaction of TiO2 surface with water formed Ov sites responsible for water oxidation, specially separated from Pd nanoparticle sites for CO2 reduction. In contrast, Pd nanoparticle sites were competed by CO2 and H species, and the photoconversion of CO2 was suppressed at the elevated pressure of CO2 + H2."
Evaluation of ultraviolet light toxicity on cultured retinal pigment epithelial and retinal ganglion cells,Clinical Ophthalmology,2010,"Sankarathi Balaiya, Ravi K Murthy, Vikram&amp;nbsp;S Brar, Kakarla V ChalamDepartment of Ophthalmology, University of Florida College of Medicine, Jacksonville, FL, USAPurpose: Our study is aimed at evaluating the role of UVB light in inducing cytotoxicity in an in vitro model.Methods: RGC-5 and ARPE-19 cells were exposed to different time periods of UVB light: 0, 15, 30, and 45 min. They were subsequently examined for changes in cell morphology, cell viability (neutral red uptake assay), generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), expression of bax, bcl-2 and cytochome C by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and western blot, respectively.Results: Dose-dependent reduction in cell viability to UVB light was demonstrated with parallel increase in ROS. Increased duration of exposure (&amp;gt;15 minutes), was associated with increased expression of bax and cytochrome C, and absence of bcl-2 expression.Conclusion: UVB light exposure results in cell cytotoxicity. The concomitant generation of ROS and expression of apoptotic markers suggests the role of oxidative stress in UVB-mediated apoptosis in an in vitro model of retinal ganglion and pigment epithelial cells.Keywords: ultraviolet light, retinal pigment epithelium, retinal ganglion cell, reactive oxygen species, cytochrome C "
Glucose-derived carbon materials with tailored properties as electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction,Beilstein Journal of Nanotechnology,2019,"Nitrogen-doped biomass-derived carbon materials were prepared by hydrothermal carbonization of glucose, and their textural and chemical properties were subsequently tailored to achieve materials with enhanced electrochemical performance towards the oxygen reduction reaction. Carbonization and physical activation were applied to modify the textural properties, while nitrogen functionalities were incorporated via different N-doping methodologies (ball milling and conventional methods) using melamine. A direct relationship between the microporosity of the activated carbons and the limiting current density was found, with the increase of microporosity leading to interesting improvements of the limiting current density. Regardless of the doping method used, similar amounts of nitrogen were incorporated into the carbon structures. However, significant differences were observed in the nitrogen functionalities according to the doping method applied: ball milling appeared to originate preferentially quaternary and oxidized nitrogen groups, while the formation of pyridinic and pyrrolic groups was favoured by conventional doping. The onset potential was improved and the two-electron mechanism of the original activated sample was shifted closer to a four-electron pathway due to the presence of nitrogen. Interestingly, the high pyridinic content related to a high ratio of pyridinic/quaternary nitrogen results in an increase of the onset potential, while a decrease in the quaternary/pyrrolic nitrogen ratio favors an increase in the number of electrons. Accordingly, the electrocatalyst with the highest performance was obtained from the activated sample doped with nitrogen by the conventional method, which combined the most appropriate textural and chemical properties: high microporosity and adequate proportion of the nitrogen functionalities."
Nitrogen doped large mesoporous carbon for oxygen reduction electrocatalyst using DNA as carbon and nitrogen precursor,Electrochemistry Communications,2012,"By using herring sperm DNA as carbon and nitrogen precursor and commercial hydrophilic nano-CaCO3 as hard-template, a one step and green method to synthesize nitrogen doped large mesoporous carbon (N-LMC) is presented. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nitrogen adsorptionâ€“desorption and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were employed to confirm the characterizations of N-LMC. The as-prepared material exhibited higher electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) than LMC. Moreover, the influence of different amounts of N-bonding configurations formed at different carbonization temperatures in N-LMC for the ORR was researched. Results indicated that N-LMC treated at 800Â Â°C (N-LMC-800) with high amounts of pyridinic N and graphitic N showed improved electrocatalytic activity for the ORR.

Effect of metal ad-layers on Au(111) electrodes on electrocatalytic reduction of oxygen in an alkaline solution,Electrochemistry Communications,2004,"Oxygen reduction reaction was investigated in an O2-saturated 0.1 M NaOH solution at Au(111) single crystal electrodes modified with various ad-metals (Cu, Ag and Bi) by underpotential deposition (upd). An increase in the catalytic activity was observed upon deposition of metal ad-atoms submonolayer for all prepared electrodes: Cu ad-layer was found, for the first time, to show a very interesting positive catalytic effect in contrast with reported data in acidic media, i.e., an apparent four-electron reduction process due to considerable enhancement of the disproportionation of hydrogen peroxide on the 1/3 monolayer (ML) Cu-modified Au(111) electrode. An interesting catalytic activity was also obtained at the 1/3 ML Ag ad-atoms modified Au(111) electrode, where a significant increase in reduction current was shown to suggest a four-electron reduction of oxygen to water. The Bi ad-atoms modified Au(111) electrode, Bi(2Ã—2)â€“Au(111), showed positive catalytic activity by a limiting current of twice higher than at a bare Au(111) electrode with peak potential at ca. âˆ’0.38 V vs. Ag|AgCl|KCl(sat).

Co/NÃ¢Â€Â“C nanotubes with increased coupling sites by space-confined pyrolysis for high electrocatalytic activity,Green Energy & Environment,2017,"Searching low cost and non-precious metal catalysts for high-performance oxygen reduction reaction is highly desired. Herein, Co nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon (Co/NÃ¢Â€Â“C) nanotubes with internal void space are successfully synthesized by space-confined pyrolysis, which effectively improve the cobalt loading content and restrict the encapsulated particles down to nanometer. Different from the typical conformal carbon encapsulation, the resulting Co/NÃ¢Â€Â“C nanotubes possess more cobalt nanoparticles embedded in the nanotubes, which can provide more coupling sites and active sites in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Moreover, the one-dimensional and porous structure provides a high surface area and a fast electron transfer pathway for the ORR. And the Co/NÃ¢Â€Â“C electrode presents excellent electrocatalytic ORR activity in terms of low onset potential (30Ã‚Â mV lower than that of Pt/C), small Tafel slop (45.5Ã‚Â mVÃ‚Â decÃ¢ÂˆÂ’1) and good durability (88.5% retention after 10,000Ã‚Â s).

"Optimization, kinetics, physicochemical and ecotoxicity studies of Fenton oxidative remediation of hydrocarbons contaminated groundwater",Egyptian Journal of Petroleum,2018,"Fenton oxidation remediation of hydrocarbons contaminated groundwater was investigated for efficiency and effectiveness. 10% pollution was simulated in the laboratory by contaminating groundwater samples with diesel and domestic purpose kerosene (DPK) in two different experimental set ups. Optimum conditions of concentrations of the treatment solutions and pH were established: 300Â mg/L (FeSO4), 150,000Â mg/L (H2O2) and pHÂ =Â 3 for the kerosene contaminant; 100Â mg/L (FeSO4), 300,000Â mg/L (H2O2) and pHÂ =Â 3 for the diesel contaminant. The results from kinetics study show that the remediation process is pseudo-first order reaction with a rate constant of 8.07Â Ã—Â 104Â mgLâˆ’1hrâˆ’1 and 3.13Â Ã—Â 104Â mgLâˆ’1hrâˆ’1 for the diesel and kerosene contaminants in that order with 95.32% and 79.25% reduction in chemical oxygen demand (COD) for diesel and kerosene contaminated samples at the end of the remediation process respectively indicated that remediation have occurred significantly. Percent reduction in Total Petroleum Hydrocarbon (TPH) as kerosene was 89.84% and that of the diesel contaminant as 91.87% after 6Â hours of remediation. The general pollution index (GPI) for the hydrocarbons contaminated samples was in the range of 6.70â€“7.52 against the background value of 4.39 for the control groundwater sample. After treatment the GPI had dropped to 4.13â€“4.43 which depicts remarkable remediation although the samples remained impaired. Therefore there is the need of post-treatments to make the groundwater fit for domestic and agricultural uses. The application of the Fenton oxidative process is found to be very efficient, effective and rapid in reducing total petroleum hydrocarbon as kerosene and diesel as target contaminants.

Ni-CeO2/C Catalysts with Enhanced OSC for the WGS Reaction,Catalysts,2015,"In this work, the WGS performance of a conventional Ni/CeO2 bulk catalyst is compared to that of a carbon-supported Ni-CeO2 catalyst. The carbon-supported sample resulted to be much more active than the bulk one. The higher activity of the Ni-CeO2/C catalyst is associated to its oxygen storage capacity, a parameter that strongly influences the WGS behavior. The stability of the carbon-supported catalyst under realistic operation conditions is also a subject of this paper. In summary, our study represents an approach towards a new generation of Ni-ceria based catalyst for the pure hydrogen production via WGS. The dispersion of ceria nanoparticles on an activated carbon support drives to improved catalytic skills with a considerable reduction of the amount of ceria in the catalyst formulation."
The tripeptide feG regulates the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species by neutrophils,Journal of Inflammation,2006,"<p>Abstract</p> <p>Background</p> <p>The D-isomeric form of the tripeptide FEG (feG) is a potent anti-inflammatory agent that suppresses type I hypersensitivity (IgE-mediated allergic) reactions in several animal species. One of feG's primary actions is to inhibit leukocyte activation resulting in loss of their adhesive and migratory properties. Since activation of neutrophils is often associated with an increase in respiratory burst with the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), we examined the effect of feG on the respiratory burst in neutrophils of antigen-sensitized rats. A role for protein kinase C (PKC) in the actions of feG was evaluated by using selective isoform inhibitors for PKC.</p> <p>Results</p> <p>At 18h after antigen (ovalbumin) challenge of sensitized Sprague-Dawley rats a pronounced neutrophilia occurred; a response that was reduced in animals treated with feG (100 Î_g/kg). With antigen-challenged animals the protein kinase C (PKC) activator, PMA, significantly increased intracellular ROS of circulating neutrophils, as determined by flow cytometry using the fluorescent probe dihydrorhodamine-123. This increase was prevented by treatment with feG at the time of antigen challenge. The inhibitor of PKCÎ´, rottlerin, which effectively prevented intracellular ROS production by circulating neutrophils of animals receiving a naÃ¯ve antigen, failed to inhibit PMA-stimulated ROS production if the animals were challenged with antigen. feG treatment, however, re-established the inhibitory effects of the PKCÎ´ inhibitor on intracellular ROS production. The extracellular release of superoxide anion, evaluated by measuring the oxidative reduction of cytochrome C, was neither modified by antigen challenge nor feG treatment. However, hispidin, an inhibitor of PKCÎ_, inhibited the release of superoxide anion from circulating leukocytes in all groups of animals. feG prevented the increased expression of the Î_1-integrin CD49d on the circulating neutrophils elicited by antigen challenge.</p> <p>Conclusion</p> <p>feG reduces the capacity of circulating neutrophils to generate intracellular ROS consequent to an allergic reaction by preventing the deregulation of PKCÎ´. This action of feG may be related to the reduction in antigen-induced up-regulation of CD49d expression on circulating neutrophils.</p> "

Spectroscopic studies of the iron and manganese reconstituted tyrosyl radical in Bacillus cereus ribonucleotide reductase R2 protein.,PLoS ONE,2012,"Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) catalyzes the rate limiting step in DNA synthesis where ribonucleotides are reduced to the corresponding deoxyribonucleotides. Class Ib RNRs consist of two homodimeric subunits: R1E, which houses the active site; and R2F, which contains a metallo cofactor and a tyrosyl radical that initiates the ribonucleotide reduction reaction. We studied the R2F subunit of B. cereus reconstituted with iron or alternatively with manganese ions, then subsequently reacted with molecular oxygen to generate two tyrosyl-radicals. The two similar X-band EPR spectra did not change significantly over 4 to 50 K. From the 285 GHz EPR spectrum of the iron form, a g(1)-value of 2.0090 for the tyrosyl radical was extracted. This g(1)-value is similar to that observed in class Ia E. coli R2 and class Ib R2Fs with iron-oxygen cluster, suggesting the absence of hydrogen bond to the phenoxyl group. This was confirmed by resonance Raman spectroscopy, where the stretching vibration associated to the radical (C-O, Î_(7a)â€_=â€_1500 cm(-1)) was found to be insensitive to deuterium-oxide exchange. Additionally, the (18)O-sensitive Fe-O-Fe symmetric stretching (483 cm(-1)) of the metallo-cofactor was also insensitive to deuterium-oxide exchange indicating no hydrogen bonding to the di-iron-oxygen cluster, and thus, different from mouse R2 with a hydrogen bonded cluster. The HF-EPR spectrum of the manganese reconstituted RNR R2F gave a g(1)-value of âˆ_2.0094. The tyrosyl radical microwave power saturation behavior of the iron-oxygen cluster form was as observed in class Ia R2, with diamagnetic di-ferric cluster ground state, while the properties of the manganese reconstituted form indicated a magnetic ground state of the manganese-cluster. The recent activity measurements (Crona et al., (2011) J Biol Chem 286: 33053-33060) indicates that both the manganese and iron reconstituted RNR R2F could be functional. The manganese form might be very important, as it has 8 times higher activity."
Oxygen reduction reaction activities of Ni/Pt(111) model catalysts fabricated by molecular beam epitaxy,Electrochemistry Communications,2010,"Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activities were evaluated for clean Pt(111) and Ni/Pt(111) model catalysts fabricated by molecular beam epitaxy. Exposure of clean Pt(111) to 1.0Â L CO at 303Â K produced linear-bonded and bridge-bonded CO-Pt IR bands at 2093 and 1858Â cmâˆ’1. In contrast, 0.3-nm-thick Ni deposited on Pt(111) at 573Â K (573Â K-Ni0.3Â nm/Pt(111)) produced broad IR bands for adsorbed CO at around 2070Â cmâˆ’1; the separation of reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) streaks is slightly wider for 573Â K-Ni0.3Â nm/Pt(111) than for the clean Pt(111). For 823Â K-Ni0.3Â nm/Pt(111), the separation of the RHEED streaks is the same as that for the Pt(111), and a single sharp IR band due to adsorbed CO is located at 2082Â cmâˆ’1. The results suggest that for the 823Â K-Ni0.3Â nm/Pt(111), a Pt-enriched outermost surface (Pt-skin) was formed through surface segregation of the substrate Pt atoms. ORR activities for the 573Â K- and 823Â K-Ni0.3Â nm/Pt(111) as determined from linear sweep voltammetry curves were five times and eight times higher than that for clean Pt(111), respectively, demonstrating that Pt-skin generation is crucial for developing highly active electrode catalysts for fuel cells.

Application of novel methods in environmental and health hazardous pollutants removal using nanophotocatalysts,Majallah-i Ì’IlmÄ«-i DÄÅnishgÄÅh-i Ì’UlÅ«m-i PizishkÄ«-i SimnÄÅn,2016,"Photo catalytic technology has been studied extensively since 1970. A lot of researches have been done to understand the basic processes and structure and photo catalyst efficiency increasing, particularly for the prevention and control of water, air and soil pollution. This method is attractive because of the impossibility of removing many contaminants to conventional and common methods and using atmospheric oxygen as the oxidizer, the possibility of complete mineralization of organic matters to the H2O and CO2 and this process could be used under the environmental conditions. During the past year a lot of attention has been paid to the reaction of photo semiconductors, metal oxides such as Titanium dioxide, Zinc oxide, zirconium dioxide, tungsten trioxide and cadmium sulfide (photo catalytic oxidation). In this case, nanotechnology will find wide application in the future with the creation of a new approach in the photo catalyst industry. In nano -scale particles, not only area increases considerable, but also other effects on optical and electromagnetic properties will be increased. Studies showed that photo catalytic reaction rate increases with the particle size reducing and increasing in the oxidation &ndash; reduction potential, significantly. Even in some conditions, the energy emitted from the light source can be used in place of ultraviolet radiation and it could be the effective energy source for photo catalyst. Nano photo catalysts with the hydrophilic and strength nanostructured catalytic properties due to their high surface area to volume are one of the key technologies for environmental pollutant control. The nano photo catalyst technology could have used for applications in water filtration systems, waste and air for removal of resistant and dangerous contaminants properly."
New Antibacterial Silver(I) Coordination Polymers Based on a Flexible Ditopic Pyrazolyl-Type Ligand,Polymers,2019,"In the last two decades, a tremendous amount of attention has been directed towards the design of antibacterial silver(I)-based materials, including coordination polymers (CPs) built up with a great variety of oxygen and nitrogen-containing ligands.

Structural stability and O2 dissociation on nitrogen-doped graphene with transition metal atoms embedded: A first-principles study,AIP Advances,2015,"By using first-principles calculations, we investigate the structural stability of nitrogen-doped (N-doped) graphene with graphitic-N, pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N, and the transition metal (TM) atoms embedded into N-doped graphene. The structures and energetics of TM atoms from Sc to Ni embedded into N-doped graphene are studied. The TM atoms at N4V 2 forming a 4N-centered structure shows the strongest binding and the binding energies are more than 7 eV. Finally, we investigate the catalytic performance of N-doped graphene with and without TM embedding for O2 dissociation, which is a fundamental reaction in fuel cells. Compared to the pyridinic-N, the graphitic-N is more favorable to dissociate O2 molecules with a relatively low reaction barrier of 1.15 eV. However, the catalytic performance on pyridinic-N doped structure can be greatly improved by embedding TM atoms, and the energy barrier can be reduced to 0.61 eV with V atom embedded. Our results provide the stable structure of N-doped graphene and its potential applications in the oxygen reduction reactions."

Long Non-Coding RNA MALAT1 Protects Human Osteoblasts from Dexamethasone-Induced Injury via Activation of PPM1E-AMPK Signaling,Cellular Physiology and Biochemistry,2018,"Background/Aims: Dexamethasone (Dex) induces injuries to human osteoblasts. In this study, we tested the potential role of the long non-coding RNA metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (Lnc-MALAT1) in this process. Materials: Two established human osteoblastic cell lines (OB-6 and hFOB1.19) and primary human osteoblasts were treated with Dex. Lnc-MALAT1 expression was analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assay. Cell viability, apoptosis, and death were tested by the MTT assay, histone-DNA assay, and trypan blue staining assay, respectively. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling was evaluated by western blotting and AMPK activity assay. Results: Lnc-MALAT1 expression was downregulated by Dex treatment in the established osteoblastic cell lines (OB-6 and hFOB1.19) and primary human osteoblasts. The level of Lnc-MALAT1 was decreased in the necrotic femoral head tissues of Dex-administered patients. In osteoblastic cells and primary human osteoblasts, forced overexpression of Lnc-MALAT1 using a lentiviral vector (LV-MALAT1) inhibited Dex-induced cell viability reduction, cell death, and apoptosis. Conversely, transfection with Lnc-MALAT1 small interfering RNA aggravated Dex-induced cytotoxicity. Transfection with LV-MALAT1 downregulated Ppm1e (protein phosphatase, Mg2+/ Mn2+-dependent 1e) expression to activate AMPK signaling. Treatment of osteoblasts with AMPKÎ±1 short hairpin RNA or dominant negative mutation (T172A) abolished LV-MALAT1-induced protection against Dex-induced cytotoxicity. Furthermore, LV-MALAT1 induced an increase in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate activity and activation of Nrf2 signaling. Dex-induced reactive oxygen species production was significantly attenuated by LV-MALAT1 transfection in osteoblastic cells and primary osteoblasts. Conclusion: Lnc-MALAT1 protects human osteoblasts from Dex-induced injuries, possibly via activation of Ppm1e-AMPK signaling."

Ternary non-noble metal chalcogenide (Wâ€“Coâ€“Se) as electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction,Electrochemistry Communications,2007,"In this study, a catalyst based on a novel ternary non-noble metal chalcogenide, Wâ€“Coâ€“Se, was synthesized for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in acidic medium. The non-noble metal chalcogenide catalyst was electrochemically stable in the potential range of 0.05â€“0.8Â V versus NHE in 0.5Â M H2SO4 aqueous solution. This catalyst demonstrated significant catalytic activity towards the ORR, showing the ORR onset potential at 0.755Â V versus NHE in 0.5Â M H2SO4 at 25Â Â°C. Such high activity might be attributed to the electronic structure of non-noble metals modified by chalcogen.

Electrochemical reduction of oxygen on double-walled carbon nanotube modified glassy carbon electrodes in acid and alkaline solutions,Electrochemistry Communications,2010,"The oxygen reduction reaction has been investigated on double-walled carbon nanotube (DWCNT) modified glassy carbon (GC) electrodes in acid and alkaline media using the rotating disk electrode (RDE) method. The surface morphology and composition of DWCNT samples was examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Aqueous suspensions of DWCNTs were prepared using Nafion and non-ionic surfactant Triton X-100 as dispersing agents. The RDE results indicated that the DWCNT modified GC electrodes are active catalysts for oxygen reduction in alkaline solution. In acid media DWCNT/GC electrodes possess poor electrocatalytic properties for O2 reduction which indicates lack of metal catalyst impurities in the DWCNT material studied. The oxygen reduction behaviour of DWCNTs was similar to that of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) observed in our previous studies.

Here the authors report that the oxygen reduction reaction in Li-O2 battery exhibits negative differential resistance, which can work as an indicator to the reaction pathway."
Room temperature redox reaction by oxide ion migration at carbon/Gd-doped CeO2 heterointerface probed by an in situ hard x-ray photoemission and soft x-ray absorption spectroscopies ,Science and Technology of Advanced Materials,2013,"In situ hard x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HX-PES) and soft x-ray absorption spectroscopy (SX-XAS) have been employed to investigate a local redox reaction at the carbon/Gd-doped CeO2 (GDC) thin film heterointerface under applied dc bias. In HX-PES, Ce3d and O1s core levels show a parallel chemical shift as large as 3.2 eV, corresponding to the redox window where ionic conductivity is predominant. The window width is equal to the energy gap between donor and acceptor levels of the GDC electrolyte. The Ce M-edge SX-XAS spectra also show a considerable increase of Ce3+ satellite peak intensity, corresponding to electrochemical reduction by oxide ion migration. In addition to the reversible redox reaction, two distinct phenomena by the electrochemical transport of oxide ions are observed as an irreversible reduction of the entire oxide film by O2 evolution from the GDC film to the gas phase, as well as a vigorous precipitation of oxygen gas at the bottom electrode to lift off the GDC film. These in situ spectroscopic observations describe well the electrochemical polarization behavior of a metal/GDC/metal capacitor-like two-electrode cell at room temperature."
Mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum stress pathways cooperate in zearalenone-induced apoptosis of human leukemic cells,Journal of Hematology & Oncology,2010,"<p>Abstract</p> <p>Background</p> <p>Zearalenone (ZEA) is a phytoestrogen from <it>Fusarium </it>species. The aims of the study was to identify mode of human leukemic cell death induced by ZEA and the mechanisms involved.</p> <p>Methods</p> <p>Cell cytotoxicity of ZEA on human leukemic HL-60, U937 and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was performed by using 3-(4,5-dimethyl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Reactive oxygen species production, cell cycle analysis and mitochondrial transmembrane potential reduction was determined by employing 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate, propidium iodide and 3,3'-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide and flow cytometry, respectively. Caspase-3 and -8 activities were detected by using fluorogenic Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (DEVD-AMC) and Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (IETD-AMC) substrates, respectively. Protein expression of cytochrome c, Bax, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL was performed by Western blot. The expression of proteins was assessed by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel-electrophoresis (PAGE) coupled with LC-MS2 analysis and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) approach.</p> <p>Results</p> <p>ZEA was cytotoxic to U937 > HL-60 > PBMCs and caused subdiploid peaks and G1 arrest in both cell lines. Apoptosis of human leukemic HL-60 and U937 cell apoptosis induced by ZEA was via an activation of mitochondrial release of cytochrome c through mitochondrial transmembrane potential reduction, activation of caspase-3 and -8, production of reactive oxygen species and induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress. Bax was up regulated in a time-dependent manner and there was down regulation of Bcl-xL expression. Two-dimensional PAGE coupled with LC-MS2 analysis showed that ZEA treatment of HL-60 cells produced differences in the levels of 22 membrane proteins such as apoptosis inducing factor and the ER stress proteins including endoplasmic reticulum protein 29 (ERp29), 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein, heat shock protein 90 and calreticulin, whereas only <it>ERp29 </it>mRNA transcript increased.</p> <p>Conclusion</p> <p>ZEA induced human leukemic cell apoptosis via endoplasmic stress and mitochondrial pathway.</p> "
Preparation of gold nanoparticles and carbon dots by hydrothermal reaction of bovine haemoglobin with chloroauric acid and energy band bending in carbon dots,Journal of Experimental Nanoscience,2017,"The incubation and hydrothermal reaction under alkaline condition of bovine haemoglobin with chloroauric acid were investigated. The products in the supernatant from the centrifuge were found to be gold nanoparticles and carbon dots. Greigite (Fe3S4) was found as a byproduct in the precipitation. In the incubation process, the reduction ability of bovine haemoglobin molecules was activated under alkaline condition (pH â‰ˆ 12), and Au(III) ions underwent progressive reduction to form Au nanoparticles in situ. In the hydrothermal reaction, denatured bovine haemoglobin molecules underwent biomineralisation to form carbon dots and greigite. Photoluminescence was used as a measurement of the energy band bending of as-prepared carbon dots. The effects of the acceptor 4-nitrotoluene and donor N,N-diethylaniline molecules on the photoluminescence intensity imply that oxygen-contained surface groups induce the upward band bending of carbon dots."
Î_-Ray irradiation as highly efficient approach for synthesis of supported high Pt loading cathode catalyst for application in direct methanol fuel cell,Electrochemistry Communications,2008,"In this study, a Î_-ray irradiation approach without addition of any commonly used reducing chemicals has been explored to synthesize carbon-supported high Pt loading (i.e., 80 wt.%) cathode catalyst for direct methanol fuel cell. Compared with the Pt catalyst prepared by impregnation-NaBH4 reduction approach, the supported Pt catalyst synthesized by Î_-ray irradiation has better dispersion of Pt nanoparticles on the carbon support with smaller particle size and narrower size distribution and has demonstrated enhanced catalytic activity toward oxygen reduction reaction and improved fuel cell performance.

Determination of the thicknesses of the active layer and cathode limiting currents in AFC,Electrochemistry Communications,2004,"A series of double-layered gas diffusion electrodes with two different electrocatalysts, i.e., Ag and pyrolyzed macrocycle mixture (PMM) were prepared in order to find out the maximum limiting current densities (iL) by varying the oxygen partial pressures in 6 M KOH and at 65 Â°C. As optimization of the active (catalyst) layer is important for better utilization of the catalytic reactions for oxygen reduction and thereby attainment of high current density, electrochemical measurements in half-cells were carried out to substantiate the currentâ€“thickness relationships. The thicknesses for both the active layers and diffusion layers were determined by using SEM. iL for an oxygen concentration simulating that of air was found to be 2.2 Acmâˆ’2 for the PMM with 0.51 mm and 1.6 Acmâˆ’2 for the Ag-based catalyst with 0.56 mm thicknesses of the active layer. An overlay of a mathematical model, describing the parameters for determination of iL, has also been inserted alongside the experimental values.
